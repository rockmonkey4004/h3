After workout lunch-
Trying out a sheep yogurt I found at Whole Foods & added all the toppings ðŸ¤—

Ingredients
* 1/4 Cup Old Chatham Creamery sheep yogurt (could also sub a vegan/dairy free yogurt)
* 1/4 Cup grain free granola (homemade or store bought, I love Purely Elizabeth)
* 1 1/2 Tablespoon Nuttzo mixed nut & seed butter
* Handful of berries
* 1 Tablespoon unsweetened coconut
* 1 Teaspoon ground chia seed
* 1 Teaspoon ground flax seed
* Drizzle of honey

Mix it all together and enjoy!
