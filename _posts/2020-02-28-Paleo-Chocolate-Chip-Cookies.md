It is paleo & egg free! I use grass-fed butter but you can sub palm shortening if needed.

Ingredients
* 2 flax egg
* 6 tbsp maple sugar & 6 tbsp coconut sugar
* 12 tbsp butter, softened
* 1/2 cup almond butter or cashew butter
* 2 cups almond flour
* 1/2 cup coconut flour
* 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 11/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 1/2 cup chocolate chips

Instructions
1. Make flax egg- combine 2 Tablespoons of ground flax seed and 5 Tablespoons of boiling water. Let sit for 10-15 minutes.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer cream together room temperature butter, sugars and almond butter until fluffy. Add vanilla and flax egg, beating until combined (should be a fluffy and sticky texture).
3. Add almond flour, coconut flour, salt, and baking soda and mix until combined.
4. Mix in chocolate chips by hand.
5. Place dough in fridge for at least 30 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 350F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
7. Scoop and roll dough into balls. Place on sheet & flatten with hands
8. Bake for about 12-15 minutes or until golden on the edges
9. Store completely cooled cookies in an air tight container.

****I have also stored the already formed cookie slices in freezer. You can take out and immediately bake it. You can also make the dough into a log form and freeze it that way.

Chocolate Chip cookies have always been a favorite of mine. Since going mostly paleo five years ago I've tried almost every recipe out there and never was satisfied. So I started recipe testing my own. I hope you love it as much as I do and if you make it please share!
