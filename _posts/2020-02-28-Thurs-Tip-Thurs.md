Tip Thursday will be focused on small digestible changes capable of making an extensive impact as time progresses.

I learned a significant amount on my journey. In the beginning, I struggled to find clean items at grocery store, and critically evaluate household/beauty products. Also, I floundered in managing my stress, and selecting exercise type and frequency.

I hope to help educate others on ingredients/products to be mindful of when approaching food and lifestyle changes.

My goal with Tip Thursday is to ease the stress often felt with making healthier choices.
Small steps when beginning your own journey of *“health, healing, & hope”* can lead to significant cumulative impact down the road.
