I love making cashew butter because it’s way cheaper to make than buy it from a store.

Ingredients

#### Nut Butter:
* 2 cups raw cashews (organic)
* Dash of salt (optional)
* Sweetener (honey or maple syrup - optional)
* Vanilla extract (optional)


Instructions
1. Put into food processor and blend until desired consistency is reached


You can also add salt, a sweetener and vanilla extract to make it extra tasty. I generally keep mine simple because I like to use it in my protein ball recipe.
