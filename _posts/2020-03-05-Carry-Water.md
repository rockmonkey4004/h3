Did you know that 43% of adults drink less than 4 cups of water a day? According to Mayo Clinic, women need about 11.5 cups and men need 15.5 cups. Keep in mind those are averages so other factors like exercise, pregnancy, overall health and environment may change the amount your body needs.

Every tissue, cell, and organ in your body needs water to function properly. Water helps your temperature remain normal, rids the body of waste, and protects joints and sensitive tissues. Even if your body is mildly dehydrated, it can drain energy and cause fatigue.

In order for me to drink as much water as my body needs, I carry a water bottle. I take it everywhere I go: the gym, grocery store, errands, friend’s houses, and I drink out of it at home. By carrying it everywhere, I can keep track of how much I drink and it serves a reminder to continue to hydrate.

Small steps when beginning your own journey of “health, healing, & hope” can lead to significant, cumulative, and impactful results down the road. Take a small step by making a goal tomorrow, this week, month to start carrying a water bottle. Trust in the small steps to lead to significant impacts down the road.
