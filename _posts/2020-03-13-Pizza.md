I want to share our pizza recipe. My husband’s part always includes mozzarella. I generally do sheep & goat’s milk feta on mine. I use any leftover meat we have from the week as a topping. Generally, the meat toppings include grilled chicken or Applegate’s turkey sausage or pepperoni (I do not eat pork).

Enjoy & happy Friday friends!
