I want to share our pizza recipe. My husband’s part always includes mozzarella. I generally do sheep & goat’s milk feta on mine. I use any leftover meat we have from the week as a topping. Generally, the meat toppings include grilled chicken or Applegate’s turkey sausage or pepperoni (I do not eat pork).

* 1 Caulipower paleo pizza crust
* ½ Rao’s marinara sauce
* 1-2 cups organic mozzarella cheese
* ¼ cup crumbled feta
* ½ cup cut grilled chicken
* 10- 15 slices of turkey pepperoni
* 1 tsp Italian herb seasoning
* Dash of fennel side (optional)
* Dash of red pepper (optional)

#### Instructions
1. Put all the toppings on the pizza crust
2. Bake at 425F for 18-22 minutes


Enjoy & happy Friday friends!
