I just finished my workout and now I am eating one of my favorite snacks.

It is easy to make and satisfies both sweet and savory lovers. I use a cracker for this but you can do bread or a rice cake!

Ingredients

* 1 gluten free crispbread from Trader Joe's
* 1-2 tablespoons of nut butter of choice (I do almond but peanut butter could also be used)
* 1 small sliced banana
* A sprinkle of cinnamon on top
* About 2 teaspoons of honey to drizzle
* Dash of crushed sea salt



#### Instructions
1. Toast the crispbread
2. Add nut butter
3. Slice and add banana
4. Sprinkle with cinnamon and salt
5. Drizzle with honey
