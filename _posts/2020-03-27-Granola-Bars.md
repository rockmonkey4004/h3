I want to share my No Sugar-Added Granola Bar recipe. It is a versatile and flexible recipe meaning you can use any nuts, nut butter, protein powder, or dried fruit in your pantry. As long as the measurements are the same, it will turn out great. I generally make a big batch, freeze half, and store the rest in the fridge. Enjoy!
