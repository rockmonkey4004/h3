Happy Friday! It is beautiful in Nashville today which means it is the perfect time to grill out and make this easy salad. I generally make this with my [Greek Chicken and Taztziki Sauce](/2020/04/03/Greek-Tzatziki.html). You can also serve it with crackers or on top of bread for an appetizer.



Greek Cucumber Salad

Servings: 4

Ingredients

* 1 cucumber diced
* ½ - ¾ cup diced tomatoes
* ¼ cup crumbled feta (omit for paleo)
* 1 teaspoons olive oil
* 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
* Salt & pepper to taste

Instructions
1. Chop cucumber and tomatoes
2. Add to a bowl
3. Mix in the rest of the ingredients
4. Enjoy
** I generally make it 2-4 hours before serving, it’s best to allow the flavors to marinate if time allows
