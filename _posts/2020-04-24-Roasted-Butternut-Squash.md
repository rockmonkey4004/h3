description: Roasted butternut squash is one of my all-time favorite side dishes. Although, I sometimes opt for the already cubed butternut squash it is noticeably better if you buy it and chop it yourself. It’s worth the effort, trust me. I love to use any leftovers we have on salad, my favorite being my “Burger Up” house salad.
