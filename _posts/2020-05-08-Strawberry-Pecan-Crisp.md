Last weekend we went to a farm and picked strawberries so I obviously had to make a strawberry crisp. It turned out so yummy, I could not wait to share it with you! If you do not have strawberries on hand, no worries as any berries will work.

Servings: 4

Strawberry Filling
Ingredients
* 4 ½ cup chopped strawberries
* ¼ cup honey (or maple syrup)
* 2 ½ tablespoons arrowroot powder
* 1 ½ tablespoons lemon juice
* ½ teaspoon cinnamon

Topping
* 1 cup gluten free oats
* 7 tablespoons softened grass-fed butter
* ½ cup almond flour
* ½ cup chopped pecans
* 1/3 cup coconut sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* ¼ fine sea salt


Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
2. Add chopped strawberries, honey, arrowroot, lemon juice and cinnamon to a 9 by 9 square pan and stir until combined.
3. In a medium size bowl stir together the oats, almond flour, pecans, coconut sugar, vanilla extract and salt.
4. Add in softened butter and stir until combined (can use a hand mixer but I always use my hands).
5. Add the topping mixture to the strawberry filling and spread it out evenly.
6. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the filling is bubbling around the edges.
7. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
8. Enjoy with vanilla ice cream!

**** If using frozen strawberries, let them thaw completely.
