This recipe is easy to do and always a crowd pleaser. It is a fantastic way to up your taco game and avoid store bought salsa loaded with extra ingredients.

Ingredients
* 6 small/medium sized roma tomatoes
* 2 habaneros
* 2 jalapenos
* ½ yellow onion
* 1 sliced red pepper
* 2 lime juiced
* Handful of cilantro
* Fine sea salt

Instructions
1.	Start grill and preheat to 350-400F (We use apple wood chips to give a complementary smoke flavor)
2.	Slice and deseed the habaneros, jalapenos, red pepper (Pro tip – put on latex/nitrile gloves for handling peppers)
3.	Chop onion in half and then in quarters
4.	Add roma tomatoes, sliced habaneros, jalapenos, red pepper and onion onto a grill safe pan
5.	Grill at indirect heat at 350-400F until the red pepper edges are slighting brown / black and the skin of the tomatoes should start to peel off
6.	Remove skin from the Roma tomatoes and add all the ingredients from the grill to a food processor. Add fresh lime juice, cilantro and sea salt and pulse until it has reached your desired consistency
7.	Store in an airtight container and refrigerate salsa for at least 2 hours before serving

**** If you like spicy salsa you can always add another jalapeno or habanero and/or avoid deseed jalapenos/habaneros
