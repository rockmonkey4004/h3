If you missed it, I am a coffee lover. When I decided to give up refined sugar, it made going to a coffee shop a little harder. Sugar is a sneaky ingredient and is in all the fun drinks like an iced mocha!
I decided it was time to create my own mocha sauce. Let me tell you: it will make you not miss Starbucks at all. Enjoy an iced mocha with all the yumminess but without the sugar crash.
