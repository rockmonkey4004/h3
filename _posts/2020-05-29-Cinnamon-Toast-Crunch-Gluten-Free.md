I made @halfbakedharvest Cinnamon Toast Crunch recipe and had to make a glutenfree and refinedsugarfree one. I hope you enjoy!

Servings: 3 cups

Ingredients
* ½ tablespoon cinnamon plus ¼ teaspoon
* ¼ cup maple sugar
* 1 ¼ cups King Arthur All Purpose Gluten free flour
* ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
* 8 tablespoons grass-fed butter (cut into cubes)
* ¼ cup cold water
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1-2 tablespoons melted grass-fed butter


Instructions
1.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2.	Combine the maple sugar and ½ tablespoon on cinnamon in a small bowl.
3.	In the food processor, combine the gluten free flour, 1/3 teaspoon cinnamon, fine sea salt and chopped butter. Pulse until it starts to clump together. Then add the vanilla and 1 tablespoon of cold water at a time. Keep adding the water until the dough comes together. Note, the dough will be sticky.
4.	Flour a piece of parchment paper and form the dough into a ball (I had to add a little bit of flour to the dough). Add in 1 tablespoon of the cinnamon sugar mixture and fold into dough.
5.	Next roll out dough until it is about 1/8 inch thick.
6.	Brush melted butter all over the dough and sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly.
7.	Cut into ½ inch squares.
8.	Bake for 14 minutes. Remove from oven and separate the squares and flip them.
9.	Bake for an additional 4-8 minutes or until golden brown. Let them cool on a wire rack and store in an airtight container for up to one week!


** My dough was too sticky to separate the squares before putting them in the oven, that is why I say do it after it has baked a while. Also, if you can flip your dough you can coat both sides with butter and cinnamon sugar (just use half cinnamon sugar mixture on each side).
