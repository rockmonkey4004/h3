Instead of #topictuesday today, I thought I would share an easy and perfect summer recipe. I always loved my Mom’s chicken salad and knew I needed to make my own version. I love to eat it over greens, with crackers, or with some toasted bread.

Mom’s Chicken Salad (paleo, egg free)

Servings: 4

Ingredients
* 2 chicken breasts shredded (or can use rotisserie)
* 1/3 cup @followyourheart mayonnaise
* ¾ cup chopped grapes
* ½ cup chopped walnuts
* ½ cup chopped celery
* ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
* ½ teaspoon onion powder
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* Ground pepper to taste

Instructions
1. To make the chicken, add water to the bottom of your crockpot and place chicken in the water. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook on high for 2-3 hours or low until chicken is cooked all the way through.
2. Take chicken out and shred.
3. Combine all the ingredients into a bowl and stir until combined.
4. Keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
***** I do not like a ton of mayo, so add as little or as much as you like. If you do not have grapes, I also love chopped apple and/or Craisins.
