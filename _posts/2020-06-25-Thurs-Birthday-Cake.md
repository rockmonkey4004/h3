Easy & Healthier Birthday Cake

Today, I am sharing tips on how to make an easy and healthy (ier) birthday cake. My first tip is make your own powdered sugar. Store bought powdered sugar is filled with refined sugar and cornstarch. My powdered sugar is made with pure maple sugar and a little bit of arrowroot. I promise it is even better than store bought both tastewise, and healthwise.

You can also use coconut sugar. I gravitate towards maple sugar because it is lighter in color with a really great flavor.

It is simple and keeps in the panty. All you need is 1 cup maple sugar and 2 teaspoons arrowroot. Add them blender and blend until it turns into a powder.
