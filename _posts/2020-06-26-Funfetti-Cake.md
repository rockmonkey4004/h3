This recipe is easy and can be paleo and vegan with a few tweaks. I cannot find paleo sprinkles, so unfortunately those have refined sugar but they are dye free.

I am a big fan of Funfetti cake so I wanted to make it for my birthday this year. However, don’t wait until your birthday to make this. We can always find a reason to celebrate right?
This recipe is easy and can be paleo and vegan with a few tweaks. I cannot find paleo sprinkles, so unfortunately those have refined sugar but they are dye free. Also, if you are vegan, just use vegan butter instead of grass-fed. If possible use a stick butter and not the spreadable kind. Enjoy!

4. Add in the cake mix and mix until combined.

8. Let cool completely for 10 minutes and then transfer to a cooling rack.
