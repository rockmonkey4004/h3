Did you know there were so many types of sugar? What happens when you see a cookie or your favorite candy? Have you stopped to notice how your tongue salivates, or self control goes out the window?

Sugar is literally a drug for our bodies. When we eat sugar, our bodies release something called dopamine which basically means sugar activates pleasure. The same response happens with cocaine, heroin, or any addictive drug. This is why it can be so hard to stop eating sugar or eat it in moderation. We become powerless to our brains' hardwired response to seek out pleasure.

Not only is sugar addictive but it is also said to cause weight gain, increasing risk of heart disease, acne, type 2 diabetes, cancer, depression, cellular ageing, obesity, can lead to a fatty liver, and chronic diseases. Those are just a few examples of what sugar can do to our bodies.

Sugar can be a sneaky ingredient because it goes by hundreds of names as listed about. It can be found in our tomato sauces, salad dressings, meats (like bacon and turkey meat), yogurt, bread, beverages, and so much more.

We know sugar is not necessarily good for our bodies. Now what? My first recommendation is to take time to go through your fridge, freezer, pantry and read the labels. I bet you will be surprised with how many of them have sugar in them. Also, familiarize yourself with all the different names of sugar.  At the store, plan extra time to read the labels so you can buy the tomato sauce that does not have added sugar. Sugar is not created equally and certain types are far better than others (something I will cover at a later date). It was enlightening to see how much and where sugar shows up.

For Tip Thursday, I am going to share some more tips on what we can do to kick the sugar carvings, and lessen the amount we consume. If you want to read more about the effects of sugar on our bodies, I recommend looking up Dr. Mark Hyman. He has been a source of information for me as I have made lifestyle changes over the years.

Lastly, change does not happen overnight so do not shame or overwhelm yourself. Start with educating yourself, and making a realistic plan. My lifestyle has not become what it is in a day, or even a year. It is an ongoing journey.
