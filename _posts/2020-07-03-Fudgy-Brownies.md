I hope you guys are having a great weekend so far! I am sharing one of my all-time favorite recipes- fudgy brownies with crispy edges, SO good. If you need an easy and delicious dessert for the holiday weekend, look no further. It is Gluten Free, paleo, egg-free and refined-sugar-free but I promise no one will be able to tell.

Fudgy Brownies (paleo & vegan friendly)

Servings: 16 brownies

Ingredients
* 4 tablespoons ground flaxseed
* ½ cup boiling water
* 1/2 softened grass-fed butter
* 1 cup coconut sugar
* 1/3 cup pure maple syrup
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 1 cup almond flour
* 1 cup coco powder
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
* ¼- ½ cup paleo chocolate chips

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350F and place parchment paper in an 8 by 8 square pan.
2. Add 4 tablespoons ground flaxseed and ½ cup boiling water and let sit for 15 minutes.
3. Add the softened butter, flax eggs, coconut sugar, maple syrup and vanilla extract to a bowl and mix until combined.
4. Add the almond flour, coco powder, baking soda & sea salt.
5. Fold in chocolate chips.
6. Place batter in prepared pan and spread evenly (the batter will be sticky).
7. Bake for 35-40 minutes (mine take 36-37) or until edges are crispy and top with flacked sea salt if desired.
8. Let cool completely. Store at room temperature for a day and then transfer to the fridge.
** To make vegan I would substitute palm shortening or Earth Balance stick butter
