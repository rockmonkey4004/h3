Last week, I shared a little bit about refined sugar and reasons why I avoid it. Today, I wanted to talk about better alternatives to refined sugar and share why they are better.

Some types of natural sugar include raw honey, pure maple syrup, blackstrap molasses, and coconut sugar. The main difference is these occur in their natural form (not refined or processed) and have some beneficial health properties. For example, honey contains high vitamin and mineral contents as well as antimicrobial benefits, which is why it has been known as a healing food for quite some time. Coconut sugar has nutrients like zinc, calcium, potassium and iron. Refined sugar does not have any nutrients, which is why it is often referred to as empty calories.

Natural sugar has a lower glycemic effect, which means it does not cause as high of a rise in blood sugar as refined sugar.

Now, just because natural sugar is better, does not necessarily mean we should live off of it. Natural sugar is still sugar and should be consumed modestly. Although making the swap from refined to natural is a great choice, you may need to get off sugar entirely to kill the addiction.

Although, I am at a point in my health journey where I am able to enjoy treats with natural sugar, this was not always the case. There were times when I had to be off all added sugar and even limit the amount of fruit I consumed.

I believe the food we consume can/will vary based on what our bodies are needing. What is your body needing? Do you desire to break the addiction of sugar?

On Thursday, I am going to share some tips and steps we can take to limit our consumption of sugar and why getting off sugar for even a week may be the step your body needs.
