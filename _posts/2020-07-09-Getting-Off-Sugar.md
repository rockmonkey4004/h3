Did you know that sugar is 8 times more addictive than cocaine? Sugar is said to be the root cause of our obesity epidemic and chronic diseases. Dr. Mark Hyman says, “Being addicted to sugar and flour is not an emotional eating disorder. It’s a biological disorder, driven by hormones and neurotransmitters that fuel sugar and carb cravings — leading to uncontrolled overeating”.
Here are some of my tips to getting off of sugar, or lowering your intake of it.

1. Get off sugar for 10 days- there are lots of sugar detox plans out there and getting off sugar cold turkey is really the only thing we can do to kick the addiction
2. Read ingredients- educate yourself on what you are putting into your body. This will not only be eye opening but you will discover which brands do not have added sugar or preservatives.
3. Stop drinking sugar- a 16oz white chocolate mocha has 53 grams of sugar. Even real fruit juice has on average 24 grams of sugar. Ditch the orange juice and eat the orange.
4. Prepare for emergencies- pack snacks, in your purse, in a drawer at your office, or in your fridge. That way if you get hungry or find yourself reaching for the donuts your coworker brought in, you have a choice.
5. Have a piece of fruit- if you find yourself craving sugar, cut up a peach or an apple. Add a fat, like almond butter to help keep you full and balance your blood sugar.
