As many of you already know, I was diagnosed with Rosacea fulminans a little over a month ago. It came up out of the blue but luckily with the help of my dermatologist, it cleared up within a couple weeks and has not recurred since.

To be honest, I slacked skin care and never even washed my face until a few years ago. With age and then this recent diagnosis I wanted to make changes recommended by my
dermatologist to my skin care routine.

For the past few years, I used products by Rodan and Fields. However, these last two weeks, I used the products shown in the picture and already noticed a vast improvement in my skin.
These products were specifically recommended by my dermatologist based on skin and medical history. I am not saying this is what is right for everyone because there is not one size fits all when it comes to skin. What works for me, may not work for you and vice versa.

I would highly recommend consulting with a dermatologist to build out a tailored approach for your specific skin. For me, the tailored approach by the dermatologist means that I no longer buy a host of products (R&F, Ulta, BeautyCounter, etc) thus saving money and ultimately have better results for my specific skin.

My rosacea fulminans was actually believed to result from a high amount of vitamin B I was taking, without doctor approval. I did not know too much of a B vitamin could cause a reaction that it did with me.

To make a long story short, I believe in balance and I believe in taking a holistic approach to medicine. I would not be where I am today health wise without a holistic approach to health.

To help heal my #rosaceafulminans, I did take an antibiotic and use a steroid cream but I also stayed away from high inflammatory foods, sun and tried to monitor my stress. It took both to get it to clear up just like it has taken both to help heal my adrenal fatigue, hypothyroidism, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, parasites, depression and, anxiety.

All of our bodies are different and the road to health, healing, and hope may not look the same but I am here sharing my journey with you in hopes that it empowers and inspires you to do the same.
