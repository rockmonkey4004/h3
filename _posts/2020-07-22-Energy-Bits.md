Happy hump day! I spent most of the afternoon deep cleaning our bedroom and enjoying the rainy day here in Nashville.

I thought I would share my Energy Bite recipe because we could all use a little more energy on this Wednesday, right? Honestly though, this is a great snack to keep in the fridge to grab before a workout or rushing out the door.

Energy Bites (gluten free, refined sugar free)
Servings: 12 bites

Ingredients
* 1 cup gluten free oats
* ¾ cup shredded coconut
* 2 tablespoon ground flax seed
* 2 tablespoons ground chia seed
* ½ cup cashew butter
* ¼-1/3 cup honey
* Handful of chocolate chips

Instructions
1. In a medium sized bowl mix together all the dry ingredients.
2. Add in the wed ingredients and mix until combined.
3. Form into 12-15 balls.
4. Store in the refrigerator.
**** I like to have wet hands when I form the energy bites, it makes it easier. Also, if the dough is not forming just add a little bit more honey.
