description: I wanted to discuss a little real talk today. I am trying to be transparent in all areas of my life. Instagram can start to become a place where only the good things are caught on camera or shared in a post. However, I feel like I am struggling, like I know so many of us have, with the loss of Beau, not seeing my family, struggling to find my “purpose”, along with everything else going on. I felt lost and feel like I am living under water for a number of days.

I wanted to discuss a little real talk today. I am trying to be transparent in all areas of my life. Instagram can start to become a place where only the good things are caught on camera or shared in a post. However, I feel like I am struggling, like I know so many of us have, with the loss of Beau, not seeing my family, struggling to find my “purpose”, along with everything else going on. I felt lost and feel like I am living under water for a number of days.

As I ponder the last few months and prepare for what the next couple could be, I realized many of my emotions have been “both and”. Let me explain a little. I think we have been taught it is either or. For example, you are either happy or sad, grateful or unappreciative. However, I feel both sad and joyful. It is possible to hold grief and joy, thankfulness and discontentment, in the same hand or to live in pain and also live in tremendous hope.

I am working on telling myself to ride whatever wave of emotion or emotions I am feeling. Today, I am extremely sad, overwhelmed, and confused but I am also hopeful and incredibly thankful.

I am struggling but in the struggle and the times of despair, I am reminded of the strength, the power and beauty that dwells within me. Life Is not just about the peaks. It is the chaos behind the picture, the slow Saturday mornings on the couch, or the tears shed from the loss of something or someone you loved. Life is hard, painful, beautiful, and it is worth the risk. To choose to love and live is to choose to lose and grieve. A life without pain and hardship is not a life at all. So, wherever you are, however you are feeling today, ride the wave.
