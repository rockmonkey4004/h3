Crazy snack girl over here! Anyone else? Seriously though, I think I love snacks because I am not limited to choosing one thing. I can have a little bit of everything. I thought I would share some of my favorite healthier options for snacks.

Simple Mills Crackers- They have all kinds but I love the almond flour ones. They are paleo, vegan and real ingredients.

HU Kitchen - Chocolate bars without refined sugar? THE BEST. I use them for all my baking, or when I just need a little chocolate in my life.

Almond Butter- I love just about anything with almond butter but be mindful of what the ingredients are. I buy unsalted so mine is just almonds.

Hope Foods Hummus- A lot of hummus brands have high inflammatory oils in them. This brand uses just olive oil and is delish.

Good Foods Queso- Non-dairy queso sold at Costco. I love to add it to roasted veggies!

Fruits & Veggies- Just make sure you are washing/soaking them.

These are small changes and a good way to enjoy snacking on real food. If you want to read more on mindful snacking, I shared a little more in a post a couple months ago. If you try them, let me know what you think or let me know some of your favorite snacks.
