The other day my mind started going all sorts of ways. I could tell I was sinking into a worst-case scenario mindset. As my mind started to race so did my heart, which in turn triggered my anxiety. I could tell my body was physically responding to what I was thinking and feeling. I knew that slowing down and focusing on my breath would help to reground me.

So, I laid on my couch with one hand on my belly and the other on my heart, and I breathed. Slow breath in, slow breath out. I repeated some mantras in term releasing the fear, the weight, and breathed in truth.

Deep breathing did not always come naturally and if I am being honest it still takes a deliberate effort because we are not used to breathing deeply. It can be a little uncomfortable and takes a little bit of practice. I thought I would share some of the first steps that Harvard health recommends.

“Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit or lie down. First, take a normal breath. Then try a deep breath: Breathe in slowly through your nose, allowing your chest and lower belly to rise as you fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Now breathe out slowly through your mouth (or your nose, if that feels more natural).”

Even if all you can do is a minute, take some time to take a deep breath today.
