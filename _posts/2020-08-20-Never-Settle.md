Tip Thursday: IBS

First off - a quick disclaimer - I want to say I am in no way giving medical advice. I just want to share a little more of my story by talking about how my IBS healed and the changes I made to feel better.

 I honestly wish I could say one thing, like food, on its own heals IBS but it is not the case. When I was in the thick of it, not able to eat much of anything, I needed to understand what was going on. I needed to stop diagnosing my symptoms and discover the root cause.

I talked about it before but my root cause for a lot of my health issues was parasites. Once I addressed my root cause, I started to see my health quality improve.

It took almost a year to get rid of the parasites and almost five years to be where I am now health wise. In the beginning, I wanted an easy fix but what I now believe is true healing and addressing the root cause is not an easy fix but it is a lasting one.

To aid in the healing, I made immense lifestyle adjustments, from diet, sleep, exercise, to learning how to manage my stress. Also, I took supplements and vitamins to help my body restore and replenish. I did colonics (still do) which is a colon cleanse to clear my body of the parasites. I conducted multiple natural parasite cleanses but I also did a strong antibiotic.

Healing is not one size fits all so the approach to medicine for disease should not be a one and done. I guarantee if I did not do a mix of things I would not be where I am today.

I will admit there were times where taking a pain pill to finally ease the pain, or aid in sleep. It was not the ultimate answer. It did not actually help me feel better. In fact, I worsened. Yes, true healing is the harder choice. It means being your own advocate, choosing to make your own cookie instead of buying Oreos, or giving up the adrenaline rush from high intensity workouts to the slow pace of a walk.

There were times these last couple years where giving up and only addressing my symptoms was much more appealing. I am so thankful I continue to fight for my health and for myself.

All of this to say, sometimes the path to true healing is the less attractive choice because it requires change, commitment, and discipline. I can tell you it is worth it. You are worth it. Your body is worth it.

If you are struggling with irritable bowel, autoimmune disease, pain, fatigue, migraines, or any medical disease there is hope. You know your body best so be your own advocate. I know the journey feels long, impossible, disappointing but do not settle. You are worth it so show up for yourself, even when you do not want to because it is arduous. This girl felt horrible, overwhelmed and exhausted but I kept showing up for myself, I kept fighting.
