Easy tips healthy swaps for desserts
1. Sub applesauce for butter and/or oil.
2. Use flax eggs instead of eggs.
3. Use coconut sugar instead of cane/brown sugar.
4. Add collagen for some extra protein.
5. Use less sugar- if I am following someone elseâ€™s recipe, I almost always can do less sugar
6. Consider using natural sweeteners- like dates, mashed bananas etc. For example, when I
make nut milk, I sweeten it with dates rather than maple syrup.
7. Freeze half of the dough. Whenever I make cookies, I almost always freeze half the
dough to help with self-control and then you always have an easy dessert on hand.
8. Half the recipe-limit the treats. If the recipe is not freezer friendly, I generally half it.
9. Some dessert recipes allow for flour subs- if so almond and oat flour are great. You can
also always keep a paleo all-purpose flour in your panty.

P.S. If you have not turned my chocolate cookies into a [cookie ice cream sandwich](https://h3withlaura.com/2020/02/28/paleo-chocolate-chip-cookies/), do it!
