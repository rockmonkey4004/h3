When I lived in Anchorage, a local restaurant did a cookie skillet with caramel sauce and ice cream on top. They served it warm and it was to die for. I still think about it so I decided to create a paleo and egg free version. The caramel sauce is optional but highly encouraged. Serve in slices or eat it straight from the pan.

Servings: 8

Ingredients
Cookie Skillet:
* 1 flax eggs
* 7 tablespoons softened unsalted grass-fed butter
* 6 tablespoons maple sugar
* 1/3 cup unsalted cashew butter
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 ¾ cup almond flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 10 almond butter cups or 1 cashew chocolate Hu Kitchen bar

Caramel Pecan Sauce: (optional)
* ¼ cup pure maple syrup
* 2 tablespoons pecan butter (I used salted)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Dash of salt (if your nut butter is not salted)

Instructions
1. Add 1 Tbsp ground flaxseed and 2.5 Tbsp of boiling water and let sit for at least 15 minutes.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (except chopped almond butter cups).
3. In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and maple sugar.
4. Then add the vanilla extract, flax egg, and cashew butter to the mixing bowl. Mix until combined.
5. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until a sticky dough is formed.
6. Fold in the almond butter cups.
7. Spray cake pan with coconut oil and evenly spread out the dough.
8. Sprinkle the remainder of almond butter cups pressing them down slightly.
9. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 2 hours or overnight.
10. Preheat the oven to 350(F) degrees.
11. Bake for 15-22 minutes (mine took about 18, it should look a little underdone in the middle).
12. If making caramel pecan sauce, while the cookie skillet is baking, in a small saucepan over medium heat, add all the ingredients for the caramel pecan sauce. Whisk until all the ingredients are mixed and become smooth.
13. Bring to a boil and whisk continuously for about a minute or until the sauce starts to thicken up.
14. Allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving and drizzle with caramel pecan sauce..
15. Best enjoyed with vanilla ice cream on top. Enjoy!

** The cashew butter I used had salt in it, if yours doesn’t you may want to up the amount of salt you add to ¼ teaspoon. If you don’t have almond butter cups just add chocolate chips!
