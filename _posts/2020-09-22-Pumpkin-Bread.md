Fall is officially here! This recipe is a labor of love! It took four times to perfect it but it was worth the effort! This is gluten free, egg free, and easily made vegan by using vegan butter. I personally love pumpkin bread with a glaze but you can also do chocolate chips. Happy Fall!

Ingredients
Bread:
* 5 tablespoons unsalted grass-fed butter*
* 1 can pumpkin puree
* ½ cup [maple syrup](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082DBXXR6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B082DBXXR6&linkId=63e5b4c0f205e3682c37a6010bbff3fd)
* 2 flax eggs
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 ¾ cup [King Arthur gluten free flour](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JJ9H1Q8/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01JJ9H1Q8&linkId=97fa717ff0f6360a1ee5dd249e825f88)*
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
* Optional: Chocolate chips

Maple Glaze:
* ½ cup maple sugar powdered sugar
* 1 tablespoons unsweetened nut milk (or more if you want it thinner)
* ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line an 8 ½ by 4 ½ inch loaf pan with parchment paper and spray with coconut oil.
2. Cut butter into slices and add to a saucepan over medium high heat. Cook until butter starts to foam and turns a light brown color. It should start to smell “nutty”.
3. Immediately transfer butter into a bowl and let it cool. It should be a light brown color. Let cool for at least 15 minutes. You can easily just melt the butter and not brown it but this gives the bread such a yummy flavor.
4. Add 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed and 5 tablespoons boiling water and let sit for at least 15 minutes.
5. In a medium sized bowl, mix together all the dry ingredients (except chocolate chips if using).
6. In a large mixing bowl, add the pumpkin puree, maple syrup, flax eggs, and vanilla extract.
7. Whisk together until smooth and slowly whisk in the browned butter.
8. Add the dry ingredients into the wet and mix until combined.
9. Fold in chocolate chips if using.
10. Pour batter into the loaf pan evenly and bake for 55-60 minutes (mine took 58 mins).
11. Allow bread to cool for 15 minutes and then remove and cool on a wire rack.
12. To make maple glaze, combine all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Pour over cooled pumpkin bread and enjoy!

Tips:
If using vegan butter I suggest using a stick of butter and not the spreadable kind

I use King Arthur gluten free flour because it does not have corn in it, however it does use grains so it is not paleo.
