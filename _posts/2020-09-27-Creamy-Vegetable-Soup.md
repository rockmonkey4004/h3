* 1 small yellow onion chopped
* ½ cup chopped carrots
* 2 garlic cloves chopped

* 2 ½ cups vegetable broth (or chicken if not vegan)
* 1 cup unsweetened almond or cashew milk
* ¼ vegan queso or nutritional yeast*
* ½ lemon juiced
* 1 tsp fine sea salt (or to taste)
* Fresh ground pepper

Instructions
1. In a Dutch Oven or soup pot, over medium heat, add avocado oil, rice cauliflower, broccoli, butternut squash, onion and sauté for 5-7 minutes.
2. Add in garlic, salt, and pepper and sauté for a few more minutes.
3. Make arrowroot slurry by combining arrowroot powder and whisking until combined until no clumps remain.
4. Add vegetable broth, almond milk, vegan queso, and arrowroot slurry and bring to a boil.
5. Turn heat to low and simmer for 15-30 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
6. Serve with crackers and vegan or regular cheese if desired.

Tips
** I personally do not love the flavor of nutritional yeast so I added in a vegan queso. If you are not dairy free you could do cheese instead

** If you do not have butternut squash feel free to use potato or sweet potato
** You can sub fresh veggies for frozen or vise versa
