Anyone else have blueberries in your fridge or freezer? Growing up in Alaska we would always pick blueberries in August and September. So before I go all pumpkin and apple, I thought I would share my mini blueberry scone recipe. I personally like mini size but if you like the bakery style size just double the recipe! These are paleo, egg free and easily made vegan by using vegan butter.

Ingredients
* 1 [flax egg](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DOKFLYI/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00DOKFLYI&linkId=06c100c0b80203f02a228dabea5ca73f)
* 3 tablespoons unsalted grass-fed or vegan butter softened and cubed
* ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons [almond flour](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CLLV2D0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00CLLV2D0&linkCode=as2&tag=h3withlaura-20&linkId=95d673b6047b5d309c17d3e4b4fdb312)
* 3 tablespoons [tapioca flour](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VQO4YJC/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00VQO4YJC&linkId=9fb90abefdb414d2d4d5b93f92d98764)
* 3 tablespoons [maple syrup](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074V3V186/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074V3V186&linkId=c795a8d456d528de71906d10bbc46d47)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* ½ cup frozen or fresh blueberries
* 2 tablespoons unsweetened nut milk

Instructions
1. Make flax egg by combining 1 tablespoons ground flaxseed and 2.5 tablespoons boiling water and let sit for 15 minutes.
2. Mix together the almond flour, tapioca flour, baking powder, and fine sea salt in a medium sized bowl. Using either a [pastry cutter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CX1RIMQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01CX1RIMQ&linkId=9f41c94c1e4f8a33803a39c347dc6f22), two forks, or your hands, mix in the cubed butter until the mixture comes together in pea sized crumbs.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the flax egg, maple syrup, and vanilla. Pour over the flour mixture and mix until combined.
4. Fold in the frozen blueberries (do not thaw before) or fresh.
5. Cover dough and freeze for thirty minutes. Freezing the dough makes it much easier to handle.
6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and spread a little tapioca flour on it.
7. Take the dough out of the freezer and place on floured parchment paper. Form an 8 inch disk and cut with a knife cut into 8 wedges. Freeze the cut dough for 10 minutes.
8. Take out of the freezer and pull the scones at least 2 to 3 inches apart.
9. Brush scones with nut milk and bake for 18-25 (mine took 22)  minutes or until golden on top.
10. Sprinkle with [paleo powdered sugar](https://h3withlaura.com/2020/06/25/thurs-birthday-cake/) if desired and enjoy!


** They are best served warm right out of the oven. Store in the fridge for 5 days or at room temperature for a couple.
** If you want to make big bakery style scones you can double this recipe but you may need to bake it for longer
