* 1 tablespoon unsweetened [almond milk](https://h3withlaura.com/2020/08/28/almond-milk/)
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 Degrees F and line a loaf pan with parchment paper or with coconut oil spray.
Prepare flax egg by combining 1 tablespoon ground flax seed and 2 ½ tablespoons boiling water. Let sit for 10- 15 minutes.
2. In a small bowl, mix together the coconut sugar and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.
3. In a large mixing bowl, add almond flour, tapioca flour, maple sugar, baking soda, baking powder, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon  and sea salt and mix well.
4. Add in the flax egg, apple sauce, almond  milk, apple cider vinegar and vanilla extract. Mix with a hand or still mixer and whisk until combined.
5. Spread half the batter on the loaf pan and add about half the apples and cinnamon sugar mixture on top.
6. Spread the rest of the batter evenly over the apple layer and top with the remainder of the apples and cinnamon sugar mixture.
7. Bake for 50- 65  minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean. I generally check it between 30-40  minutes and cover it with foil if the top is beginning to crystallize.
8. Allow to cool for 15 minutes before slicing.
