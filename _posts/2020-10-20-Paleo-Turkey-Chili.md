####Instructions
1. In a large soup pan, over medium high heat, add the avocado oil,  onion, red pepper, and sweet potato and sauté for 5 minutes.
2. Add in ground turkey and yellow squash.
3. Break the ground turkey apart with a spoon and cook for 5 minutes or until it is browned.
4. Add all the seasonings and stir until well combined.
5. Add the broth and marinara sauce, stirring until combined.
6. Reduce to a low medium simmer for 30 minutes (lid off), stirring occasionally.
7. Enjoy it with your favorite toppings!

####Tips
To make vegan, use your choice of beans ( I like black and navy beans) and vegetable broth
If you want the chili to simmer for longer, put the heat on low
