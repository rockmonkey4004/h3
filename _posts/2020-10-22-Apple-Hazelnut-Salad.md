I made this salad last week and fell in love. The apple, hazelnuts, and hints of maple is divine. This is the perfect Fall side dish!

Ready in 20 minutes
Serves 4 people

#### Ingredients
Salad
* ½ tablespoon olive oil
* ½ cup roughly chopped raw  hazelnuts
* 2 tablespoons honey (or maple syrup)
* ⅛ teaspoon fine  sea salt
* 4 cups arugula
* 1 green apple sliced
* ¼ cup parmesan cheese (omit for paleo)
Dressing
* ⅓  cup olive oil
* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 2 tablespoons maple syrup
* 1 tablespoon dijon mustard
* 1 tablespoon gluten free soy sauce (or coconut aminos)
* Salt & pepper to taste


#### Instructions
1. In a small saucepan, over medium heat, add olive oil, hazelnuts, honey, and sea salt.
2. Stir until nuts are evenly coated.
3. Cook until nuts are golden and toasted. Let cool in a bowl.
4. To make dressing, add all ingredients into a bowl or jar and whisk until combined
5. In a salad bowl, combine all the salad ingredients and toss with dressing*


#### Tips
Vegan parmesan  cheese would also work
I did not use all the dressing, so try ¾ of it and taste then add more if needed
