Store bought powdered sugar is filled with refined sugar and cornstarch. My powdered sugar is made with pure maple sugar and a little bit of arrowroot. I promise it is even better than store bought both tastewise, and healthwise.

You can also use coconut sugar. I gravitate towards maple sugar because it is lighter in color with a really great flavor. It is so simple and keeps great in the pantry!



Servings 1 Cup

#### Ingredients
* 1 cup maple sugar
* 2 teaspoons arrowroot powder


#### Instructions
1. In a high speed blender combine the maple sugar and arrowroot.
2. Blend on high until the mixture is a powder.
