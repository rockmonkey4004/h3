I used to not be a big fan of cranberry sauce but the past couple years it has become a Thanksgiving favorite. The hints of orange, cinnamon, nutmeg and maple will make you never want to buy the canned version again! This recipe takes less than 15 minutes, can be make ahead of time and is paleo and vegan!

Ready in 15 minutes
Servings 2 cups

#### Ingredients
* 12 oz bag of fresh cranberries
* ¾ fresh orange juice from 2 navel oranges
* ½ cup maple syrup
* ½ teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Dash of fine sea salt
* Dash of nutmeg (optional)


#### Instructions
1. In a saucepan over medium high heat add the cranberries, orange juice, maple syrup, cinnamon and nutmeg.
2. Cook until the cranberries break and the sauce starts to thicken (around 7-10 minutes).
3. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract and fine sea salt.
4. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for about 10 days.

#### Tips
You can use cinnamon sticks if you have them! Just remove before consuming and make sure it does not break apart in the sauce.
Another good addition is bourbon, just add a couple tablespoons when you add all the other ingredients
