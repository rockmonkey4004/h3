#### Instructions
1. To make the cashew sauce- combine soaked and drained cashews, fresh water (do not use what you soaked the cashews in), lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, sea salt and dijon mustard in a high speed blender.
Blend until smooth and creamy.

2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
3. Slice your eggplant lengthwise into ½ inch to ¾ inch slices.
4. Add to the cookie sheet and brush with olive oil and salt and pepper.
5. Bake for 20-25 minutes and flip the eggplant at the halfway mark.
6. Combine 1 cup of cashew cream and 1 ½ cups of marinara sauce in a large bowl and stir until combined (see notes)*
7. To make the filling, in a large skillet over medium high heat add avocado oil, yellow onion, mushroom and garlic and saute for about 5 minutes.
8. Add in the zucchini, ground turkey, salt and pepper and cook until ground turkey is cooked.
9. Add ⅓ cup of cashew marina mixture to prevent it from drying out.
10. In a 9”x9” square baking dish add ¾ cup cashew marinara sauce on the bottom, then add cooked eggplant, ½ of the turkey filling and drizzle cashew cream. Repeat this step again.
11. If you have enough eggplant, add another layer and pour the rest of the cashew marinara on top. Then drizzle with cashew cream.
12. Bake at 350 Degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until bubbly.



#### Tips
If you want it to be more tomatoey, you do not have to add cashew cream. Just use 2 ½ cups marinara sauce
For storage, keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days.
To make ahead of time, make cashew cream and turkey filling and store in the fridge. Or prepare lasagna completely and store in the fridge up to 4 hours before baking
