Mindfulness around the Holidays: Food Part 2

Last week I shared about what I am learning to not let thoughts of weight start to creep in. And then I also shared some tips on how I am practically living that out.

This week I thought I would focus on those of us who, because of health issues cannot partake in festive foods. First off, I want to say that I have been there. What I am able to tolerate today, is very different from what I could two years ago. To provide some hope, what you are not able to eat today may look different in a couple years as our bodies heal and change overtime. There was a time I would have given anything to be able to have a paleo cookie, but my body was just too sensitive to sugar, even natural.

For those of you who find yourself in the category of being very limited on food here are some tips on how the holidays can still be special.

1. If you are celebrating with family, communicate ahead of time what you can/cannot eat and why. That way you are not getting pressured and getting asked why you are not eating.
2. Bring your own food- make your meal ahead of time and bring it and include a side to share with everyone.
3. Figure out a treat you can tolerate and make it or bring it- maybe that is a smoothie, or a date stuffed with nut butter with melted chocolate, an rx bar or a homemade trail mix. Whatever it is, enjoy that when others are enjoying their dessert. It will make you feel included and not as left out.
4. If you are uncomfortable bringing your own food- eat ahead of time. It will make the temptation of eating what they do more manageable.
5. Remember that you know your body best- others may offer their advice and opinions about what you are doing or what you should be doing. But you are in control of what you give power to. Do not give power to advice or opinions that you know are not right for you.
6. Consider starting a new tradition that does not revolve around food. Like driving around and looking at Christmas lights, bundling up and going on a walk and in a neighborhood that is lit up or doing a diy, like making a wreath or garland.
7. Give yourself some grace- it is hard and it is ok to be sad. Allow yourself to sit in the reality of it being hard. But then remind yourself that this is not forever and you are serving your body in the best way you know how.
