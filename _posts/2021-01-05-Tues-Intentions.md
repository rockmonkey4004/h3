Happy New Year! I hope you enjoyed the holiday season and are feeling rested and rejuvenated.

It felt good to take some time off from here. Although I love the community and talking with you guys, I can go down the comparison trap so the break was much needed!

I know I shared my thoughts on resolutions last week but this week for #topictuesday I thought I would talk a little bit about intentions. An intention is an idea that you plan to carry out. It is a purpose with a plan. An intention is giving yourself direction when in turn helps bring purpose and meaning.

Personally, my intention for the year is generally a Bible verse that I want to try and live out and focus on for the year. I write it down somewhere that can be seen and from there I set goals to keep myself accountable to the intention. Maybe it is even setting smaller intentions every month, everyday, or do what works for you.

Lastly, coming from a year like 2020, I think it is all the more important to set intentions to give us direction and purpose. I know I felt lost in 2020 and honestly it felt like groundhog day over and over. I can live with intention, even in a pandemic or at home.

How are you going to live with intention this year? This month? Today?
