I talked about setting intentions last Tuesday. Today, I want to share how I practically live intentionally every week/day etc. A lot of times we set big goals like a goal for the year and a lot of times we end up not following through with that goal.

I find setting small goals for the week or day is much more practical. None of us expected 2020 to turn out the way that it did. Setting weekly goals is easier because generally we have an idea of what our week will look like and based on that we can determine what is a reasonable and achievable goal.

I am using a planner to write my weekly goals down, check them off, and help me determine what my week looks like and what I can get done. I also make sure and fill out any tasks and appointments for the day.

For example, I am taking a little break from all sugar (except fruit) to give my body a reset. I know in order to set myself up for success, meal planning is important. It is generally when I do not have a plan I want to go for a sweet. On Monday I took the time to write the meals I am making this week and make sure my fridge was stocked with all the ingredients.
Now I am going to be honest, I generally do not have a meal plan. I enjoy deciding what I want to make the day of but I know in order to help me achieve my goal of taking a break from sugar I need to do it for the time being. My goal is not to have a meal plan for the year because that is just not a reasonable or achievable goal for me but for the 10 or so days I am allowing my body to reset, it is doable.

I hope this is helpful  but know that we are all different and what works for you may not work for me and vise versa! Lastly, give yourself grace. There is so much pressure in January to set goals, intentions, etc. Maybe right now you are just trying to survive or maybe you are suffering health wise and cannot take on anything else. Maybe you are extremely happy and satisfied with where you are. Do YOU! Do what works for you, what brings you joy and what helps put you in the direction that you want to go. All of our journeys are different so let us encourage one another and cheer each other on, instead of living in comparison and judgement.
