* Ice


#### Instructions
1. Stir together hot espresso (or coffee) and condensed milk.
2. Fill a cup with ice and pour ½ cup cashew milk (or milk of choice) and add espresso mixture. Stir and add additional  milk if needed!


#### Tips
You can find my condensed milk recipe in my free Christmas Treats E Book.
If you do not have espresso you can use regular coffee, just make it stronger and use a little more
You can also make this hot, just omit the ice.
If you are using store bought condensed milk, it is much sweeter than my homemade recipe so you may need to adjust the amount you use.
