##Vegan Chipotle Ranch

* 3-4 tablespoons [siete chipotle hot sauce](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P38KPXS/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07P38KPXS&linkId=5c70fad935e5472cf2ffcb8156bec45a) or chipotle adobe (the amount depends on the level of spice you want)
* 1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
* Ground Pepper
* Dash of fine sea salt

##Regular Chipotle Ranch
* ½ cup mayo
* ½ cup buttermilk
* ½ teaspoon onion powder
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* 3-4 tablespoons Chipotle Adobe( this depends on the level of spice you like)
* 1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
* Ground pepper
* A dash of fine sea salt if desired

##Breadsticks
* 1 pizza dough (I used homemade sourdough)
* 2 cups fresh grated pepper jack cheese
* 1 ½ cup fresh grated cheddar cheese
* Red pepper flakes


#### Instructions
1. Add all the chipotle ranch ingredients in a bowl and whisk until smooth. If you like a thinner ranch you can add more buttermilk or water a teaspoon at a time until you get the consistency you desire. Store in the fridge until ready to use. Keeps for about 5- 7 days.
2. Form the pizza dough into a rectangle and place the cheese and red pepper flakes on top. Bake according to dough/crust instructions.
3. If doing sourdough bake at 550 Degrees F for 5-7 minutes or until the crust is a golden color. Add Italian herb seasoning on top and cut into pieces. Serve warm and with the chipotle ranch!


#### Tips
You can sub any type of pizza dough, but if you do sourdough I strongly recommend it!
