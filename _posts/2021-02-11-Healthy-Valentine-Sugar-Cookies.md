* ¼ teaspoon [almond extract](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DI085/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0000DI085&linkId=af116a18c60df29cca99e82abd04625d)
* Food coloring if desired


#### Instructions
1. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
2. In a stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter until smooth (about 2 minutes).
3. Add the maple sugar and continue beating until the mixture is light and fluffy, (about 3 minutes).
4. Add the almond extract and mix until combined.
5. Add the flour mixture and  beat just until combined.
6. Remove the dough, shape it into a disk about 6 inches wide and wrap it securely in plastic wrap
7. Chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours or overnight.
8. Preheat the oven to 350 degree F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
9. Place tapioca flour on the parchment paper and place dough on top, sprinkling a little more on the dough.
10. Roll half the dough between two pieces of parchment or wax paper until it's about 1/4-inch-thick.
11. Using cookie cutters, cut out your desired shapes and place them roughly 2 inches apart on the cookie sheets.
12. Repeat the rolling and cutting process with the remaining dough (leftover scraps can be re-rolled).
13. Refrigerate the cut-out cookies for at least 15 minutes. (this helps them keep their shape when baking.)
14. Bake for 9- 11 minutes.
15. Cool completely on a wire rack before frosting.
16. For the glaze mix all ingredients in a bowl until smooth. You may need to add more powdered sugar, or cashew milk depending on how thin or thick you want it!

#### Tips
I find the cookies are best if cooled completely and then iced. Then let the icing harden before storing them.
