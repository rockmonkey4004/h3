Paleo & Vegan Black & White Mocha. Need I say more? Seriously though, if you have not heard of this drink it is traditionally done with both white mocha and mocha sauce and loaded with sugar and dairy. Mine uses both my condensed milk & mocha sauce, making it taste amazing but made without the 50 grams of sugar.

#### Ingredients
Condensed Milk:
* 1 can full fat coconut milk
* ⅓ cup [maple syrup](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074V3V186/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074V3V186&linkId=c795a8d456d528de71906d10bbc46d47) or maple sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt
Black & White Mocha
* 2 shots of espresso (can also use brewed coffee)
* 1 ½ tablespoons [mocha sauce](https://h3withlaura.com/2020/05/23/refined-sugar-free-mocha-sauce/)
* 1 ½ tablespoons homemade condensed milk
* 1 cup non-dairy milk (I used cashew)
* Ice (if doing cold)


#### Instructions
Condensed Milk
1. To make the condensed milk, whisk together coconut milk and maple syrup in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.
2. Whisking often, bring to a low simmer ( I turn mine down to low medium heat)
3. Continue whisking for 30 minutes to 1 hour or until the liquid has reduced in half.
4. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract and fine sea salt.
5. Cool completely and then store in the fridge for up to a week.
Black & White Mocha
1. To make the black and white mocha mix the mocha sauce and condensed milk with the hot espresso or hot coffee of choice. Make sure you mix it until smooth and combined.
2. Stir in the nondairy milk and pour over ice. Alternatively, for a hot black and white mocha, heat up or steam your milk.


#### Tips
If using brewed coffee instead of adding non-dairy milk you can add your choice of creamer
