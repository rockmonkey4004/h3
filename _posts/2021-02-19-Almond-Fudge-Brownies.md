Flourless, Vegan, and Paleo Brownies. These are incredibly fudgy but with a  nice crisp edge. Pair with vanilla ice cream and my goodness, they are insane.
They are super easy to make, and sure to be a crowd pleaser! They freeze well so it makes an easy go to dessert when you do not want to make anything. I generally keep a few pieces in the fridge and then store the rest in the freezer.
We are still snowed in here in Nashville, so my weekend plans include these brownies and some Netflix.
