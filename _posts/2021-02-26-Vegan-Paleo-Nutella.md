Paleo & Vegan Nutella? Your weekend plans must include making this. It is easy and is a dream on french toast, bread, in cookies, or just eaten by the spoonful.
We honestly never had Nutella in our house so my first time trying it was in Australia. Store bought Nutella is full of cane sugar,  hydrolyzed oil and dairy. I actually decided to make it because I bought a paleo version at the store but it was 13 dollars. I knew I could make it for much cheaper and equally if not better.
Let me tell you, it is amazing! Head to my website or the link in my bio for the recipe.


Ready in: 20 minutes
Servings: 1 1/2 cups



#### Ingredients
* 1 ½ cups raw hazelnuts
* 3 tablespoons [cocoa powder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IPZUZW4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01IPZUZW4&linkId=501731133214f0287a87893ab24fd734)
* ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons pure [maple syrup](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002483SRI/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B002483SRI&linkId=2cfd546bfc4f4eb408f90a1b6dc46c05)
* 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
* ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt plus a dash more (I did ¼ and then tasted it and added a little more)
* Optional(see notes): 1 tablespoon cashew milk (any nut milk will work)

#### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
2. Bake the hazelnuts for 11-14 minutes or until just lightly browned.
3. Allow the hazelnuts to cool for about 10 minutes and then place them on a tea towel and rub vigorously until the skin comes off (not all of the skin will come off but that is alright).
4. Transfer the hazelnuts to a high speed blender or food processor and blend until a flour like consistency forms. You will need to use a spatula to get it off the sides.
5. Add in the cocoa powder, maple syrup, vanilla extract and fine sea salt and blend until smooth. This will take awhile. Make sure you stop the blender and scrape down the sides and stir if needed.
6. Once it is smooth and the oil has started to separate, transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the tablespoon of cashew milk if doing.
7. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for 7-10 days.


#### Tips
You do not need to add nut milk but it does make it creamy and delicious. If you choose to not add nut milk, you can store it at room temperature for about a month.
You can also freeze for about 3 months.
