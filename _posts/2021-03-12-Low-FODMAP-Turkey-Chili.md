* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt (or to taste)
* Fresh ground pepper
* 1 cup [Low FODMAP marinara sauce](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CZ1G8X5/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B08CZ1G8X5&linkId=3c747cda860c37ecdc67d96fbdc9c6af)
* 1 1/2 cups Low FODMAP chicken broth (or more if you like a thinner chili)*
* Dash of Cayenne pepper (optional)

#### Instructions
1. In a large soup pan, over medium high heat, add the avocado oil, red pepper, and sweet potato and sauté for 5 minutes.
2. Add in ground turkey and zucchini.
3. Break the ground turkey apart with a spoon and cook for 5 minutes or until it is browned.
4. Add all the seasonings and stir until well combined.
5. Add the broth and marinara sauce, stirring until combined.
6. Reduce to a low medium simmer for 30 minutes (lid off), stirring occasionally.
7. Enjoy it with your favorite toppings!

#### Tips
If you want the chili to simmer for longer, put the heat on low for as long as you need. I do think chili gets better the longer it sits.
