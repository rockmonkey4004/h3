Letâ€™s talk about FODMAP. What is it? Why is it beneficial? Is it a lifestyle? I am going to do the best I can to answer some of the questions from the last couple weeks. Please know, I am not a medical doctor or a dietitian. Before jumping to a conclusion about diet implementation, I encourage you to seek out your practitioners input and advice.

FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. These are short-chain carbohydrates (sugars) the small intestine absorbs poorly. As these travel through the gastrointestinal tract, they draw excess fluid and generate gas when they are fermented by bacteria in the colon. This build up leads to symptoms of IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) some of which are bloating, pain, diarrhea, pain, and constipation. An estimated 10-15 percent of the world's population is said to suffer from IBS. Good news though, it is also thought following a low FODMAP diet can relieve up to 75 percent of IBS symptoms. It helps with the symptoms and there is hope for feeling better!

Low FODMAP is an elimination diet which means it is not a lifestyle but is a tool to determine food intolerances. The length of the time varys per person but the reintroduction phase is just as important as the elimination. The reintroduction phase allows for the foods causing symptoms to be identified.

I followed Low FODMAP over the two weeks and continue to adhere to it. I can tell you, I saw significant improvement. Some symptoms decreased and others disappeared all together. There is a lot to learn but I am hopeful I will be able to heal my gut in time.
