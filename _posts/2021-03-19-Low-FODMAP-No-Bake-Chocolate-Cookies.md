* ½ cup unsweetened almond milk
* 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
* 3 cups [gluten free old fashioned oats](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FUI7GNK/ref%3Das_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dh3withlaura-20%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB01FUI7GNK%26linkId%3D6d6e641b6a50623abf5739abf1eb4c3&sa=D&ust=1602639259855000&usg=AFQjCNG6YmbJLuUQDeuPdUkb6RfgXUL3DQ)
* ½ cup sunflower seed butter
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt

#### Instructions
1. Line a large cookie sheet with wax paper.
2. In a medium saucepan, over medium high heat, add butter, maple sugar, coconut sugar, almond milk and cocoa powder and bring it to a boil.
3. Stir to help the butter melt. Once it starts to boil (bubbles all around), let boil for 1 minute.
4. Remove from heat and immediately add in the oats, cashew butter, and vanilla extract mixing until combined.
5. Working fast,  using a quarter inch cookie scoop, scoop the dough on the cookie sheet and set in the fridge for 30 minutes before eating (if you want flatter cookies, flatten the cookie with a spatula)
6. Store in an airtight container in the fridge.
