Adrenal Cocktail

Have you heard of adrenal fatigue? The feeling of being “burnt out” or exhausted can be caused by adrenal fatigue which occurs as a result of chronic stress (which more than 1 million Americans suffer from) and adrenal insufficiency.

The adrenal glands, which sit on top of your kidneys, release a number of important hormones and are in charge of producing cortisol. Cortisol is often referred to as the stress hormone and plays a part in regulating blood sugar and energy.

When the body is stressed out, the adrenal glands release cortisol, which responds to a slower immune system and a change in blood pressure. Chronic stress and/or anxiety can over tax your adrenal glands and may cause them to not be able to produce enough cortisol. This is called adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal fatigue is a milder form of this.

Common symptoms of adrenal fatigue are body aches, chronic fatigue, nervousness, digestive issues, headaches, low blood pressure, weight gain or loss, and hair loss. In severe cases depression, vomiting, diarrhea and hyperpigmentation can also occur.

I was diagnosed with adrenal fatigue when I was 21 and have been battling it ever since. I was put on a steroid and was on it for almost 5 years to help support my adrenals. Recently, I discovered through a saliva test that my cortisol levels are super low in the afternoon/evening (this is when I get bad crashes). One of the things my practitioner recommended to do around lunch/early afternoon time is make this adrenal cocktail. It is super easy and very yummy! 3 ingredients that I guarantee you have in your kitchen.

* ½ cup fresh or organic orange juice
* ¼ teaspoon teaspoon cream of tartar
* ¼ teaspoon teaspoon pink Himalayan sea salt

Orange juice is a great form of vitamin C which is essential for your adrenals. The adrenal glands is where the highest concentration of vitamin C is stored in the body. Your adrenals then rely on vitamin C to make hormones, including cortisol. Cream of tartar is high in potassium (which low levels of potassium contribute to adrenal gland problems) and pink Himalayan sea salt has 84 essential minerals that help adrenals function properly.

Remember a good thing can become a bad thing if over consumed. Be mindful of how much cream of tartar you are consuming, as high amounts of potassium can be problematic. I recommend reaching out to your practitioner to see if the adrenal cocktail can be helpful for you.
