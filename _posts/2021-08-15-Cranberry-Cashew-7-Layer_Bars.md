#### Ingredients
Crust:
* 1 box smashed Simple Mills Sweet Thins Honey Cinnamon or graham crackers (about 1 ¼ cups)
* 6 tablespoons vegan or grass-fed butter

Filling:
* ½ cup chopped cashews
* ½ cup shredded coconut
* ½ cup craisins
* 1 paleo/vegan chocolate chips

Condensed Milk:
* 1 can full fat coconut milk
* ⅓ cup pure maple sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt

Chocolate Sauce:
* ½ cup paleo/vegan chocolate chips
* 1 teaspoons coconut oil

Caramel Sauce:
* ¼ cup pure maple syrup
* 2 tablespoons pecan butter (I used salted)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Dash of salt (if your nut butter is not salted)



#### Instructions
Condensed Milk:
1. Whisk together non-dairy milk and maple sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisking often bring to a low simmer.
2. Continue to simmer for about 40-60 minutes or until liquid has reduced in half (make sure you are whisking often).
3. Once reduced, remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract and fine sea salt. 4.
Cool completely and store in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.

Caramel Sauce:
1. In a small saucepan, over medium heat, add all the ingredients for the caramel pecan sauce.
2. Whisk until all the ingredients are mixed and become smooth.
3. Bring to a boil and whisk continuously for about a minute or until the sauce starts to thicken up.

7 Layer Bars:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare an 8x8 square pan with parchment paper.
2. In a small bowl, mix together melted butter and crushed cookies. Press into the bottom of the prepared pan and bake for 5 minutes.
3. Pour ¾ cup condensed milk evenly over the crumb mixture (store the rest of the condensed milk in the fridge).
4. Make chocolate sauce by combining chocolate chips and coconut oil in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir until completely melted and immediately remove from heat.
5. Layer evenly with chopped cashews, coconut, craisins and chocolate chips. Pour chocolate sauce on top.
6. Lastly, pour as much caramel sauce as desired on top.
7. Bake for 25 minutes. Let cool completely and refrigerate for 2 hours before slicing.

#### Tips
If you do not want to make homemade condensed milk, you can buy coconut condensed milk. You can also use any type of caramel.
