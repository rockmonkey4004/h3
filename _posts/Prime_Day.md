It is also great is smoothies, protein bars etc. This is an AWESOME deal. In my cart

* [Apple AirPods](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PXGQC1Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=h3withlaura-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07PXGQC1Q&linkId=d70248881a28e6b0955b191a3ecdeeea) - Not a kitchen item but I got some a few months ago and love them! I use them for running (and they do not fall out with sweat), filming or talking on the phone.
