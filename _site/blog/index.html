      <a href="/2020/05/23/Refined-Sugar-Free-Mocha-Sauce/">Mocha Sauce </a> - 23 May 2020<br />
      <p>If you missed it, I am a coffee lover. When I decided to give up refined sugar, it made going to a coffee shop a little harder. Sugar is a sneaky ingredient and is in all the fun drinks like an iced mocha!
I decided it was time to create my own mocha sauce. Let me tell you: it will make you not miss Starbucks at all. Enjoy an iced mocha with all the yumminess but without the sugar crash.</p>

      <a href="/2020/05/22/Thurs-Resounding-Yes/">Letting Go Series (Resounding Yes) </a> - 22 May 2020<br />
      <p>For #topictueaday, I shared about my goal of saying no is to create opportunity to spend my time on things I value most in life. It took me years to feel confident in saying no if it is not an unmistakable yes.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/05/19/Letting-Go-Resounding-Yes/">Letting Go Series (Resounding Yes) </a> - 19 May 2020<br />
      <p>A pattern in of my life is my desire to please others. I tend to busy myself with things, people, activities and I think the root of it comes from wanting to please others.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/05/15/Fire-Roasted-Salsa-Applewood/">Fire Roasted Salsa </a> - 15 May 2020<br />
      <p>This recipe is easy to do and always a crowd pleaser. It is a fantastic way to up your taco game and avoid store bought salsa loaded with extra ingredients.</p>

      <a href="/2020/05/14/Letting-Go-of-Exercise-for-Weightloss/">Letting Go Series (Exercise for Weightloss) </a> - 14 May 2020<br />
      <p>For #topictuesday, I shared about letting go of exercising for weight loss and exercise for my overall wellbeing.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/05/12/Letting-Go-Series-Exercise-Weightloss/">Letting Go Series (Exercise for Weightloss) </a> - 12 May 2020<br />
      <p>There have been times in my life where I exercised simply to lose weight. The harder I worked in the gym, the more I hoped to see come off the scale.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/05/08/Strawberry-Pecan-Crisp/">Strawberry Pecan Crisp </a> - 08 May 2020<br />
      <p>Last weekend we went to a farm and picked strawberries so I obviously had to make a strawberry crisp. It turned out so yummy, I could not wait to share it with you! If you do not have strawberries on hand, no worries as any berries will work.</p>

      <a href="/2020/05/05/Tues-Letting-Go-of-Stuff/">Letting Go Series (Living Minimally) </a> - 05 May 2020<br />
      <p>Continuing with the “Letting Go” series, one of the areas I felt I needed to let go of is unused stuff.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/30/Thurs-I-Am-Enough-Cont/">Letting Go Series (I Am Enough - Part 2) </a> - 30 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>On Tuesday, I shared about speaking truth into my life and letting go of the lies. One of the biggest lies I allowed in is that I am not enough. If you want to read more about how and why head to my <a href="/2020/04/28/Tues-I-Am-Enough">#topictuesday post</a>.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/28/Tues-I-Am-Enough/">Letting Go Series (I Am Enough) </a> - 28 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>As I spent time these last few weeks asking myself what I need to let go of, the notion of “Not feeling like I am enough” seems to be at forefront of my mind.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/24/Roasted-Butternut-Squash/">Roasted Butternut Squash </a> - 24 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>Happy Friday! One of my all-time favorite side dishes is roasted butternut squash. Although, I sometimes opt for the already cubed butternut squash it is noticeably better if you buy it and chop it yourself. It is worth the effort, trust me. I love to use any leftovers we have on salad, my favorite being my <a href="/2020/03/06/Burger-Up-Salad/">“Burger Up House Salad”</a>.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/23/Thurs-Letting-Go-Part-1/">Letting Go (Series - Part 1) </a> - 23 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>On Tuesday, I shared about starting a series related to letting go. Before we start, I think it is important to ponder what we need to let go of.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/21/Tues-Letting-Go/">Letting Go (Series) </a> - 21 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>If I narrowed down what I learned these past few weeks to one thing, it would be my need to let go.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/17/Thurs-Mindful-Snacking/">Mindful Snacking </a> - 17 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>On Tuesday, I talked about eating how I want to feel. It can be easy to say it aloud but how do we practically live it out?</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/17/Greek-Salad/">Greek Salad </a> - 17 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>Happy Friday! It is beautiful in Nashville today which means it is the perfect time to grill out and make this easy salad. I generally make this with my <a href="/2020/04/03/Greek-Tzatziki">Greek Chicken and Taztziki Sauce</a>. You can also serve it with crackers or on top of bread for an appetizer.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/14/Eating-How-You-Want-To-Feel/">Eat How You Want to Feel </a> - 14 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>Do you eat how you want to feel? Have you ever stopped to think about food in the context of feeling?</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/11/Whipped-Coffee/">Whipped Coffee </a> - 11 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>It is the weekend &amp; the sun is shining which means whipped coffee is happening! I thought I would share how I make mine. There is less sugar and half the amount of coffee (I try to limit my caffeine) but you can always double it. I serve it cold but it can be made hot.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/10/Banana-Bread/">Banana Bread </a> - 10 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>It is Friday and we could all use a fun Saturday morning treat. This bread is delicious and will have your house smelling like a world class bakery.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/09/Thurs-Holidays/">Easter- Making the Holiday Special Under our Circumstances </a> - 09 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>Easter is on Sunday and we might be a little sad to deviate from normal traditions. Traditions like: going to church, enjoying a big meal with family and friends, or taking the kids to find Easter eggs. It all will look a little different this year.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/07/Tues-Cleanliness/">Cleanliness </a> - 07 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>I am known for a clean house because for me it creates a space of peace and calmness. Right now, many of our homes seem to become dirtier quicker than usual with more meals eaten at home and with an increase in activity.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/03/Greek-Tzatziki/">Greek Chicken &amp; Tzatziki </a> - 03 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>This recipe is very easy to do and the best part is you can prep it ahead of time (like nap time). Enjoy!</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/04/02/Thurs-Try-Something-New/">Try Something New </a> - 02 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>We all have more time on our hands then we know what to do with. I am choosing to look at this time as a gift and prioritize things I wanted to try.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/31/Tues-Anxiety/">Anxiety </a> - 31 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>Recently, my anxiety felt more crippling. I have struggled with anxiety since high school. Through the years and through many doctors, I learned about “Candida” which is a yeast overgrowth in my gut. Candida is said to cause anxiety and other symptoms. As I started to heal my gut, I found significant relief but there were still times when it would come back.
Although my anxiety subsided, it surged back with the passing of Beau and the uncertain time we are living in. I learned some techniques to combat the anxiety when it starts to take over.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/27/Granola-Bars/">No Sugar-Added Granola Bar Recipe </a> - 27 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>This recipe is very easy to do and the best part is you can prep it ahead of time (like nap time). Enjoy!</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/26/Thurs-Wash-Produce/">Wash your Fruits and Veggies </a> - 26 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>Washing produce is important to prevent foodborne illness and reducing your exposure to pesticides. For good food hygiene, learn how to wash produce, regardless if it is organic or conventional. When washing your fruits and vegetables, making your own baking soda or salt solution may be the best option.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/25/nut-butter-toast/">Nut Butter Toast </a> - 25 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>I just finished my workout and now I am eating one of my favorite snacks.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/19/Thurs-Planner/">Use a Planner </a> - 19 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>It is a simple and effective solution. It does not need to be expense. The one I use is from Target. Although, I will say, at really crazy times in my life, I splurged on custom planners and they were worth the money.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/17/Tues-Prioritize-Sleep/">Prioritize Sleep </a> - 17 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>There is a lot that we cannot control right now but we are still in control of our response to what is going on around us. Most of us are spending more time at home and trying to come up with ideas to stay busy, keep kids entertained, and maintain our immune systems.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/13/Pizza/">Pizza </a> - 13 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>I want to share our pizza recipe. My husband’s part always includes mozzarella. I generally do sheep &amp; goat’s milk feta on mine. I use any leftover meat we have from the week as a topping. Generally, the meat toppings include grilled chicken or Applegate’s turkey sausage or pepperoni (I do not eat pork).</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/12/Thurs-Pack-Snacks/">Pack Some Snacks </a> - 12 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>For me, snacks can be a life saver. I carry an RX bar and other goodies in my purse for “emergencies”. You know the times where you run late and forget to eat breakfast, errands take longer than planned, or someone brought donuts to work?</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/10/Tue-Intermittent-Fasting/">Intermittent Fasting </a> - 10 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>Have you heard of intermittent fasting? I thought it would be a pertinent topic to touch on since it is popular now.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/06/Burger-Up-Salad/">Burger Up House Salad </a> - 06 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>Burger Up is one of my favorite restaurants in Nashville. I love their house salad and consume it every time I go. I figured I would try to make it at home.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/05/Carry-Water/">Carry a Water Bottle </a> - 05 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>Did you know that 43% of adults drink less than 4 cups of water a day? According to Mayo Clinic, women need about 11.5 cups and men need 15.5 cups. Keep in mind those are averages so other factors like exercise, pregnancy, overall health and environment may change the amount your body needs.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/03/Tue-Exercise-and-Movement/">Exercise and Movement </a> - 03 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>For Topic Tuesday, I thought I would share how I prioritize movement and exercise in my week.
Until recently, up until the last few months, I ceased any high intensity training. Prior to my sickness and even while sick, I worked out hard, often too hard. A doctor advised me to take a season of rest and I terminated working out. I primarily spent my season of rest bedridden with occasional walks a few times a week. I tried CrossFit and loved it but it caused my body to crash so I stopped.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/02/Homemade-Nut-Butter/">DIY Nut Butter </a> - 02 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>I love making cashew butter because it’s way cheaper to make than buy it from a store.</p>
