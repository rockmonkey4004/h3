      <p>Easy tips healthy swaps for desserts</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/08/25/Pumpkin-Spice/">Pumpkin Spice Sauce </a> - 25 Aug 2020<br />
      <p>I woke up to Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) season even though it still feels like summer in Nashville! I am all about jumping on board for everything pumpkin spice so obviously I created a vegan and paleo pumpkin spice sauce. I promise it is better than Starbucks and does not have all the added ingredients and 50 grams of sugar. This would also be great over pancakes, waffles…I mean pumpkin spice makes everything better right?</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/08/21/Ice_Cream_Sandwiches/">Ice Cream Sandwiches </a> - 21 Aug 2020<br />
      <p>Just make these. Seriously, they are a crowd pleaser, easy to do and you can add whatever kind or amount of ice cream that your heart desires.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/08/20/Never-Settle/">Never Settle </a> - 20 Aug 2020<br />
      <p>First off - a quick disclaimer - I want to say I am in no way giving medical advice. I just want to share a little more of my story by talking about how my IBS healed and the changes I made to feel better.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/08/14/Lemon-Dijon-Chicken/">Lemon Dijon Chicken </a> - 14 Aug 2020<br />
      <p>You all asked for dinner ideas and this will quickly become a crowd favorite. It is easy to whip together and can be prepared the morning or afternoon before dinner. I love to serve it with a side of green beans and sweet potatoes but it would pair great with rice. I think grilled chicken thigh is just the best but you can also cook it on the stove stop.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/08/13/Thurs-Just-Breathe/">Just Breathe </a> - 13 Aug 2020<br />
      <p>The other day my mind started going all sorts of ways. I could tell I was sinking into a worst-case scenario mindset. As my mind started to race so did my heart, which in turn triggered my anxiety. I could tell my body was physically responding to what I was thinking and feeling. I knew that slowing down and focusing on my breath would help to reground me.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/08/12/Paleo-Peanut-Butter-Protein-Bites/">Peanut Butter Protein Balls </a> - 12 Aug 2020<br />
      <p>Have you ever had Go Marco Bars? My husband loves them so I decided to try and make something similar. These have 5 ingredients and take less than 10 minutes to make. You can roll them into balls or bars.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/08/11/Tues-Fight-or-Flight/">Fight or Flight </a> - 11 Aug 2020<br />
      <p>Have you ever heard of the term “fight or flight”? It is known as the stress response. It activates when stressed or in danger to keep us from harm. When fired in a dangerous situation, it helps us survive to live another day. Unfortunately, this response does not just happen if you are running from a tiger. It can be from our day to day events- our packed schedules and our worries. This can result in some of the health issues we are seeing today like high blood pressure, suppressed immune system, anxiety, and depression. In fact, a lot of my health issues were from my body being in a constant state of “fight or flight”.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/08/07/Cashew-Coconut-Chocolate-Milk/">Cashew Coconut Chocolate Milk </a> - 07 Aug 2020<br />
      <p>Any chocolate lovers out there? If so, you are going to love this no sugar added, vegan and paleo chocolate milk. It is naturally sweetened with dates, and is delicious in coffee. You also do not strain cashew milk which makes for an easy clean up!</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/08/04/Living-In-Uncertain-Times/">Living in Uncertain Times </a> - 04 Aug 2020<br />
      <p>I do not know about you but lately my heart, soul, and honestly body feels heavy. The uncertainty we are living in takes a toll on me. I have allowed myself to live in fear, to accept it as true, and allow it to seep into almost every aspect of my life.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/31/Lemon-Blueberry-Muffins/">Blueberry Lemon Muffins </a> - 31 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>Blueberries are in season and this is a fantastic way to use them! These are easy to pull together, totally vegan, refined sugar free, oil free, and gluten free. The maple lemon butter kicks it up to a whole new level and the grass-fed butter can easily be replaced with vegan butter.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/30/Thurs-The-Low-Down-On-My-Snacks/">The Low Down on My Snacks </a> - 30 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>Crazy snack girl over here! Anyone else? Seriously though, I think I love snacks because I am not limited to choosing one thing. I can have a little bit of everything. I thought I would share some of my favorite healthier options for snacks.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/28/Tues-Struggling-with-the-Present/">Struggling in Many Facets </a> - 28 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>I wanted to discuss a little real talk today. I am trying to be transparent in all areas of my life. Instagram can start to become a place where only the good things are caught on camera or shared in a post. However, I feel like I am struggling, like I know so many of us have, with the loss of Beau, not seeing my family, struggling to find my “purpose”, along with everything else going on. I felt lost and feel like I am living under water for a number of days.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/25/Thurs-Choices-Choices-Choices/">Read the Labels </a> - 25 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>This is such a stellar example of why it is important to read labels. I mentioned it before but small changes can make lasting impacts. Choosing the marinara sauce without added sugar and inflammatory oils is a small but meaningful change. Next time you are at the grocery store and about to throw the marinara in the cart take a couple minutes to evaluate for clean and real ingredients.</p>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/22/Energy-Bits/">Energy Bites </a> - 22 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>Happy hump day! I spent most of the afternoon deep cleaning our bedroom and enjoying the rainy day here in Nashville.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/17/Peach-Kale-Salad/">Chopped Peach Kale Salad </a> - 17 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>Happy Friday! I hope you all have some fun weekend plans. It is peach season here in the south and although I love them most in a crisp they are also very delicious in a salad. This recipe is easy and so yummy. The goat cheese mixes in great and makes the salad creamy, light and flavorful.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/14/Tues-Skin-Care-Reboot/">Skin Care Reboot </a> - 14 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>As many of you already know, I was diagnosed with Rosacea fulminans a little over a month ago. It came up out of the blue but luckily with the help of my dermatologist, it cleared up within a couple weeks and has not recurred since.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/10/Feta-Kale-Turkey-Burgers/">Feta &amp; Kale Turkey Burgers </a> - 10 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>I love a good turkey burger over a bed of lettuce. I made this on a whim and loved it! It is very easy and versatile which makes for a perfect weeknight meal. I used rice crumbs in this recipe but if you want to keep it grain free just swap it for almond flour.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/09/Getting-Off-Sugar/">Getting off Sugar </a> - 09 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>Did you know that sugar is 8 times more addictive than cocaine? Sugar is said to be the root cause of our obesity epidemic and chronic diseases. Dr. Mark Hyman says, “Being addicted to sugar and flour is not an emotional eating disorder. It’s a biological disorder, driven by hormones and neurotransmitters that fuel sugar and carb cravings — leading to uncontrolled overeating”.
Here are some of my tips to getting off of sugar, or lowering your intake of it.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/07/Tues-Refined-vs-Natural-Sugar/">Differences Between Refined vs. Natural Sugar </a> - 07 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>Last week, I shared a little bit about refined sugar and reasons why I avoid it. Today, I wanted to talk about better alternatives to refined sugar and share why they are better.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/03/Fudgy-Brownies/">Fudgy Brownies </a> - 03 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>I hope you guys are having a great weekend so far! I am sharing one of my all-time favorite recipes- fudgy brownies with crispy edges, SO good. If you need an easy and delicious dessert for the holiday weekend, look no further. It is Gluten Free, paleo, egg-free and refined-sugar-free but I promise no one will be able to tell.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/07/01/Tues-Sugar-Everywhere/">All About Sugar </a> - 01 Jul 2020<br />
      <p>Did you know there were so many types of sugar? What happens when you see a cookie or your favorite candy? Have you stopped to notice how your tongue salivates, or self control goes out the window?</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/06/26/Funfetti-Cake/">Funfetti Cake </a> - 26 Jun 2020<br />
      <p>I am a big fan of Funfetti cake so I wanted to make it for my birthday this year. However, don’t wait until your birthday to make this. We can always find a reason to celebrate right?
This recipe is easy and can be paleo and vegan with a few tweaks. I cannot find paleo sprinkles, so unfortunately those have refined sugar but they are dye free. Also, if you are vegan, just use vegan butter instead of grass-fed. If possible use a stick butter and not the spreadable kind. Enjoy!</p>

      <a href="/2020/06/23/Chicken-Salad/">Mom's Chicken Salad </a> - 23 Jun 2020<br />
      <p>Instead of #topictuesday today, I thought I would share an easy and perfect summer recipe. I always loved my Mom’s chicken salad and knew I needed to make my own version. I love to eat it over greens, with crackers, or with some toasted bread.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/05/29/Cinnamon-Toast-Crunch-Gluten-Free/">Gluten Free Cinnamon Toast Crunch </a> - 29 May 2020<br />
      <p>I made @halfbakedharvest Cinnamon Toast Crunch recipe and had to make a glutenfree and refinedsugarfree one. I hope you enjoy!</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/05/23/Refined-Sugar-Free-Mocha-Sauce/">Mocha Sauce </a> - 23 May 2020<br />
      <p>If you missed it, I am a coffee lover. When I decided to give up refined sugar, it made going to a coffee shop a little harder. Sugar is a sneaky ingredient and is in all the fun drinks like an iced mocha!
I decided it was time to create my own mocha sauce. Let me tell you: it will make you not miss Starbucks at all. Enjoy an iced mocha with all the yumminess but without the sugar crash.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/05/22/Thurs-Resounding-Yes/">Letting Go Series (Resounding Yes) </a> - 22 May 2020<br />
      <p>For #topictueaday, I shared about my goal of saying no is to create opportunity to spend my time on things I value most in life. It took me years to feel confident in saying no if it is not an unmistakable yes.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/05/19/Letting-Go-Resounding-Yes/">Letting Go Series (Resounding Yes) </a> - 19 May 2020<br />
      <p>A pattern in of my life is my desire to please others. I tend to busy myself with things, people, activities and I think the root of it comes from wanting to please others.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/05/15/Fire-Roasted-Salsa-Applewood/">Fire Roasted Salsa </a> - 15 May 2020<br />
      <p>This recipe is easy to do and always a crowd pleaser. It is a fantastic way to up your taco game and avoid store bought salsa loaded with extra ingredients.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/05/14/Letting-Go-of-Exercise-for-Weightloss/">Letting Go Series (Exercise for Weightloss) </a> - 14 May 2020<br />
      <p>For #topictuesday, I shared about letting go of exercising for weight loss and exercise for my overall wellbeing.</p>


    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="/2020/05/12/Letting-Go-Series-Exercise-Weightloss/">Letting Go Series (Exercise for Weightloss) </a> - 12 May 2020<br />
      <p>There have been times in my life where I exercised simply to lose weight. The harder I worked in the gym, the more I hoped to see come off the scale.</p>

      <p>Last weekend we went to a farm and picked strawberries so I obviously had to make a strawberry crisp. It turned out so yummy, I could not wait to share it with you! If you do not have strawberries on hand, no worries as any berries will work.</p>

      <p>Continuing with the “Letting Go” series, one of the areas I felt I needed to let go of is unused stuff.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday, I shared about speaking truth into my life and letting go of the lies. One of the biggest lies I allowed in is that I am not enough. If you want to read more about how and why head to my <a href="/2020/04/28/Tues-I-Am-Enough">#topictuesday post</a>.</p>

      <a href="/2020/04/28/Tues-I-Am-Enough/">Letting Go Series (I Am Enough) </a> - 28 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>As I spent time these last few weeks asking myself what I need to let go of, the notion of “Not feeling like I am enough” seems to be at forefront of my mind.</p>

      <a href="/2020/04/24/Roasted-Butternut-Squash/">Roasted Butternut Squash </a> - 24 Apr 2020<br />
      <p>Happy Friday! One of my all-time favorite side dishes is roasted butternut squash. Although, I sometimes opt for the already cubed butternut squash it is noticeably better if you buy it and chop it yourself. It is worth the effort, trust me. I love to use any leftovers we have on salad, my favorite being my <a href="/2020/03/06/Burger-Up-Salad/">“Burger Up House Salad”</a>.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday, I shared about starting a series related to letting go. Before we start, I think it is important to ponder what we need to let go of.</p>

      <p>Happy Friday! It is beautiful in Nashville today which means it is the perfect time to grill out and make this easy salad. I generally make this with my <a href="/2020/04/03/Greek-Tzatziki">Greek Chicken and Taztziki Sauce</a>. You can also serve it with crackers or on top of bread for an appetizer.</p>

      <p>It is the weekend &amp; the sun is shining which means whipped coffee is happening! I thought I would share how I make mine. There is less sugar and half the amount of coffee (I try to limit my caffeine) but you can always double it. I serve it cold but it can be made hot.</p>

      <p>Easter is on Sunday and we might be a little sad to deviate from normal traditions. Traditions like: going to church, enjoying a big meal with family and friends, or taking the kids to find Easter eggs. It all will look a little different this year.</p>

      <p>I am known for a clean house because for me it creates a space of peace and calmness. Right now, many of our homes seem to become dirtier quicker than usual with more meals eaten at home and with an increase in activity.</p>

      <a href="/2020/03/31/Tues-Anxiety/">Anxiety </a> - 31 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>Recently, my anxiety felt more crippling. I have struggled with anxiety since high school. Through the years and through many doctors, I learned about “Candida” which is a yeast overgrowth in my gut. Candida is said to cause anxiety and other symptoms. As I started to heal my gut, I found significant relief but there were still times when it would come back.
Although my anxiety subsided, it surged back with the passing of Beau and the uncertain time we are living in. I learned some techniques to combat the anxiety when it starts to take over.</p>

      <p>Washing produce is important to prevent foodborne illness and reducing your exposure to pesticides. For good food hygiene, learn how to wash produce, regardless if it is organic or conventional. When washing your fruits and vegetables, making your own baking soda or salt solution may be the best option.</p>

      <p>It is a simple and effective solution. It does not need to be expense. The one I use is from Target. Although, I will say, at really crazy times in my life, I splurged on custom planners and they were worth the money.</p>

      <a href="/2020/03/17/Tues-Prioritize-Sleep/">Prioritize Sleep </a> - 17 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>There is a lot that we cannot control right now but we are still in control of our response to what is going on around us. Most of us are spending more time at home and trying to come up with ideas to stay busy, keep kids entertained, and maintain our immune systems.</p>

      <p>I want to share our pizza recipe. My husband’s part always includes mozzarella. I generally do sheep &amp; goat’s milk feta on mine. I use any leftover meat we have from the week as a topping. Generally, the meat toppings include grilled chicken or Applegate’s turkey sausage or pepperoni (I do not eat pork).</p>

      <p>For me, snacks can be a life saver. I carry an RX bar and other goodies in my purse for “emergencies”. You know the times where you run late and forget to eat breakfast, errands take longer than planned, or someone brought donuts to work?</p>

      <p>Did you know that 43% of adults drink less than 4 cups of water a day? According to Mayo Clinic, women need about 11.5 cups and men need 15.5 cups. Keep in mind those are averages so other factors like exercise, pregnancy, overall health and environment may change the amount your body needs.</p>

      <a href="/2020/03/03/Tue-Exercise-and-Movement/">Exercise and Movement </a> - 03 Mar 2020<br />
      <p>For Topic Tuesday, I thought I would share how I prioritize movement and exercise in my week.
Until recently, up until the last few months, I ceased any high intensity training. Prior to my sickness and even while sick, I worked out hard, often too hard. A doctor advised me to take a season of rest and I terminated working out. I primarily spent my season of rest bedridden with occasional walks a few times a week. I tried CrossFit and loved it but it caused my body to crash so I stopped.</p>

      <p>I spent time today organizing our pantry &amp; spice cabinet and I’m so glad I did it!
One thing that I have learned through all my health struggles is how to manage my stress. One of the ways for me is keeping the space I live in clean and organized.</p>
