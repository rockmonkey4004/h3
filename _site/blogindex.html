      <a href="/2020/03/31/Tues-Anxiety.html">Anxiety</a>
      <p>Recently, my anxiety felt more crippling. I struggled with anxiety since high school. Through the years and through many doctors, I learned about ‚ÄúCandida‚Äù which is a yeast overgrowth in my gut. Candida is said to cause anxiety and other symptoms. As I started to heal my gut, I found significant relief but there were still times when it would come back.
Although my anxiety subsided, it surged back with the passing of Beau and the uncertain time we are living in. I learned some techniques to combat the anxiety when it starts to take over.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/26/thurs-wash-produce.html">Wash your Fruits and Veggies</a>
      <p>Washing produce is important to prevent foodborne illness and reducing your exposure to pesticides. For good food hygiene, learn how to wash produce, regardless if it is organic or conventional. When washing your fruits and vegetables, making your own baking soda or salt solution may be the best option.</p>

      <a href="/2020/03/19/Thurs-Planner.html">Use a Planner</a>
      <p>It is a simple and effective solution. It does not need to be expense. The one I use is from Target. Although, I will say, at really crazy times in my life, I splurged on custom planners and they were worth the money.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/17/Tues-Prioritize-Sleep.html">Prioritize Sleep</a>
      <p>There is a lot that we cannot control right now but we are still in control of our response to what is going on around us. Most of us are spending more time at home and trying to come up with ideas to stay busy, keep kids entertained, and maintain our immune systems.</p>

      <a href="/2020/03/12/Thurs-Pack-Snacks.html">Use a Planner</a>
      <p>For me, snacks can be a life saver. I carry an RX bar and other goodies in my purse for ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù. You know the times where you run late and forget to eat breakfast, errands take longer than planned, or someone brought donuts to work?</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/10/Tue-Intermittent-Fasting.html">Intermittent Fasting</a>
      <p>Have you heard of intermittent fasting? I thought it would be a pertinent topic to touch on since it is popular now.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/05/Carry-Water.html">Carry a Water Bottle</a>
      <p>Did you know that 43% of adults drink less than 4 cups of water a day? According to Mayo Clinic, women need about 11.5 cups and men need 15.5 cups. Keep in mind those are averages so other factors like exercise, pregnancy, overall health and environment may change the amount your body needs.</p>

    <li>
      <a href="/2020/03/03/Tue-Exercise-and-Movement.html">Exercise and Movement</a>
      <p>For Topic Tuesday, I thought I would share how I prioritize movement and exercise in my week.
Until recently, up until the last few months, I ceased any high intensity training. Prior to my sickness and even while sick, I worked out hard, often too hard. A doctor advised me to take a season of rest and I terminated working out. I primarily spent my season of rest bedridden with occasional walks a few times a week. I tried CrossFit and loved it but it caused my body to crash so I stopped.</p>
