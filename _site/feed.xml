The uncertainty we are living in takes a toll on me. I have allowed myself to live in fear, to accept it as true, and allow it to seep into almost every aspect of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My anxiety worsened, self-hatred thoughts creeped in, and it just seems I am seeing everything through a lens of hopelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I was reminded to guard my heart, which means actually guarding it, by choosing what to let in. Just because I feel something does not mean I have to accept it. Yes, I feel fear, I feel hopelessness but I can choose not to accept it or to not agree with it. I can choose to not allow it to reign in my heart and in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are living in uncertain times. We do not know what tomorrow brings. There is much out of our control but let us focus on what we can control today. We can control what lens we are seeing from. We can choose to guard our hearts. We can choose to feel and not accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically, I think this can look different for everyone but for me, it is taking the time to understand why my heart or my mind is going to certain places. Then simply pausing and repeating what I know to be true and what I believe. It is getting in nature and out of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are living in uncertain times. How are you responding to the times we are living in? Are you living from a place of fear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends, let us not have a spirit of fear but one of love and self-control. Let us make deliberate intentions to choose hope.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><summary type="html">I do not know about you but lately my heart, soul, and honestly body feels heavy.

These are easy to pull together, totally vegan, refined sugar free, oil free, and gluten free. The maple lemon butter kicks it up to a whole new level and the grass-fed butter can easily be replaced with vegan butter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blueberry Lemon Muffins (vegan, gluten free, refined sugar free)
Servings: 8 muffins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients
Blueberry Muffins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup almond flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¾ cup gluten free oat flour (if using homemade make sure it is finely ground)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ tapioca flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons baking powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ teaspoon fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup full fat coconut milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ lemon zested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maple Lemon Butter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons grass-fed butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 teaspoons maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼- ½ teaspoon lemon zest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a muffin pan with cupcake liners.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a medium sized bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and lemon zest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a small bowl mix, together all the dry ingredients and add to the wet ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold in the blueberries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spoon the batter evenly into a cup or liner and bake for 20-25 minutes (mine took 22 minutes).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While the muffins are baking, mix together the butter, lemon and maple syrup until combined (can mix by hand or use an electric mixer).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serve the muffins with a dollop of maple lemon butter on top and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;

Anyone else? Seriously though, I think I love snacks because I am not limited to choosing one thing. I can have a little bit of everything. I thought I would share some of my favorite healthier options for snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple Mills Crackers- They have all kinds but I love the almond flour ones. They are paleo, vegan and real ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HU Kitchen - Chocolate bars without refined sugar? THE BEST. I use them for all my baking, or when I just need a little chocolate in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almond Butter- I love just about anything with almond butter but be mindful of what the ingredients are. I buy unsalted so mine is just almonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope Foods Hummus- A lot of hummus brands have high inflammatory oils in them. This brand uses just olive oil and is delish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Foods Queso- Non-dairy queso sold at Costco. I love to add it to roasted veggies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fruits &amp;amp; Veggies- Just make sure you are washing/soaking them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are small changes and a good way to enjoy snacking on real food. If you want to read more on mindful snacking, I shared a little more in a post a couple months ago. If you try them, let me know what you think or let me know some of your favorite snacks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="snacks" /><summary type="html">Crazy snack girl over here!

I am trying to be transparent in all areas of my life. Instagram can start to become a place where only the good things are caught on camera or shared in a post. However, I feel like I am struggling, like I know so many of us have, with the loss of Beau, not seeing my family, struggling to find my “purpose”, along with everything else going on. I felt lost and feel like I am living under water for a number of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I ponder the last few months and prepare for what the next couple could be, I realized many of my emotions have been “both and”. Let me explain a little. I think we have been taught it is either or. For example, you are either happy or sad, grateful or unappreciative. However, I feel both sad and joyful. It is possible to hold grief and joy, thankfulness and discontentment, in the same hand or to live in pain and also live in tremendous hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working on telling myself to ride whatever wave of emotion or emotions I am feeling. Today, I am extremely sad, overwhelmed, and confused but I am also hopeful and incredibly thankful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am struggling but in the struggle and the times of despair, I am reminded of the strength, the power and beauty that dwells within me. Life Is not just about the peaks. It is the chaos behind the picture, the slow Saturday mornings on the couch, or the tears shed from the loss of something or someone you loved. Life is hard, painful, beautiful, and it is worth the risk. To choose to love and live is to choose to lose and grieve. A life without pain and hardship is not a life at all. So, wherever you are, however you are feeling today, ride the wave.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><category term="anxiety" /><category term="my-story" /><category term="mindfulness" /><summary type="html">I wanted to discuss a little real talk today.

I spent most of the afternoon deep cleaning our bedroom and enjoying the rainy day here in Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I would share my Energy Bite recipe because we could all use a little more energy on this Wednesday, right? Honestly though, this is a great snack to keep in the fridge to grab before a workout or rushing out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy Bites (gluten free, refined sugar free)
Servings: 12 bites&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup gluten free oats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¾ cup shredded coconut&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoon ground flax seed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons ground chia seed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup cashew butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼-1/3 cup honey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handful of chocolate chips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a medium sized bowl mix together all the dry ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add in the wed ingredients and mix until combined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Form into 12-15 balls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store in the refrigerator.
&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt; I like to have wet hands when I form the energy bites, it makes it easier. Also, if the dough is not forming just add a little bit more honey.&lt;/li&gt;

It came up out of the blue but luckily with the help of my dermatologist, it cleared up within a couple weeks and has not recurred since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I slacked skin care and never even washed my face until a few years ago. With age and then this recent diagnosis I wanted to make changes recommended by my
dermatologist to my skin care routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, I used products by Rodan and Fields. However, these last two weeks, I used the products shown in the picture and already noticed a vast improvement in my skin.
These products were specifically recommended by my dermatologist based on skin and medical history. I am not saying this is what is right for everyone because there is not one size fits all when it comes to skin. What works for me, may not work for you and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend consulting with a dermatologist to build out a tailored approach for your specific skin. For me, the tailored approach by the dermatologist means that I no longer buy a host of products (R&amp;amp;F, Ulta, BeautyCounter, etc) thus saving money and ultimately have better results for my specific skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rosacea fulminans was actually believed to result from a high amount of vitamin B I was taking, without doctor approval. I did not know too much of a B vitamin could cause a reaction that it did with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, I believe in balance and I believe in taking a holistic approach to medicine. I would not be where I am today health wise without a holistic approach to health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help heal my #rosaceafulminans, I did take an antibiotic and use a steroid cream but I also stayed away from high inflammatory foods, sun and tried to monitor my stress. It took both to get it to clear up just like it has taken both to help heal my adrenal fatigue, hypothyroidism, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, parasites, depression and, anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our bodies are different and the road to health, healing, and hope may not look the same but I am here sharing my journey with you in hopes that it empowers and inspires you to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><summary type="html">As many of you already know, I was diagnosed with Rosacea fulminans a little over a month ago.

I made this on a whim and loved it! It is very easy and versatile which makes for a perfect weeknight meal. I used rice crumbs in this recipe but if you want to keep it grain free just swap it for almond flour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1-pound ground turkey meat (85 percent 15 percent fat)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup diced yellow onion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup rice crumbs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup finely chopped kale&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup feta (can add more or skip)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 ½ tablespoons ketchup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon Dijon mustard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon primal BBQ seasoning (optional)
Dash of salt &amp;amp; pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chop Kale and yellow onion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Combine all ingredients and mix well&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Form into burger patties (should make around 5)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heat skillet over medium high heat with avocado oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add burger patties to hot skillet and cook on each side for 4-5minutes with lid on until cooked through&lt;/li&gt;

I used rice crumbs in this recipe but if you want to keep it grain free just swap it for almond flour.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/feta-kale-turkey-burgers_veerlg.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/feta-kale-turkey-burgers_veerlg.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Getting off Sugar</title><link href="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/07/09/Getting-Off-Sugar/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting off Sugar" /><published>2020-07-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-07-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://h3withlaura.com/2020/07/09/Getting-Off-Sugar</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/07/09/Getting-Off-Sugar/">&lt;p&gt;Did you know that sugar is 8 times more addictive than cocaine? Sugar is said to be the root cause of our obesity epidemic and chronic diseases. Dr. Mark Hyman says, “Being addicted to sugar and flour is not an emotional eating disorder. It’s a biological disorder, driven by hormones and neurotransmitters that fuel sugar and carb cravings — leading to uncontrolled overeating”.
Here are some of my tips to getting off of sugar, or lowering your intake of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get off sugar for 10 days- there are lots of sugar detox plans out there and getting off sugar cold turkey is really the only thing we can do to kick the addiction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read ingredients- educate yourself on what you are putting into your body. This will not only be eye opening but you will discover which brands do not have added sugar or preservatives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop drinking sugar- a 16oz white chocolate mocha has 53 grams of sugar. Even real fruit juice has on average 24 grams of sugar. Ditch the orange juice and eat the orange.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepare for emergencies- pack snacks, in your purse, in a drawer at your office, or in your fridge. That way if you get hungry or find yourself reaching for the donuts your coworker brought in, you have a choice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a piece of fruit- if you find yourself craving sugar, cut up a peach or an apple. Add a fat, like almond butter to help keep you full and balance your blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
