It is easy to whip together and can be prepared the morning or afternoon before dinner. I love to serve it with a side of green beans and sweet potatoes but it would pair great with rice. I think grilled chicken thigh is just the best but you can also cook it on the stove stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lemon Dijon Chicken
SERVINGS: 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients
Marinade:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4-6 pieces of chicken thigh&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup avocado oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 lemon juiced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons Dijon mustard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ tablespoon honey (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon dried rosemary&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon garlic powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon onion powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon smoked paprika&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fresh ground pepper and fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feta Sauce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 tablespoons vegenaise (or regular mayo)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup chopped feta&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon red wine vinegar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon Italian seasoning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon garlic powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon onion powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ teaspoon red chili fakes (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fresh ground pepper and fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a large zip lock bag place the chicken and all the ingredients for the marinade. Close tightly and shake until marinade is mixed and evenly coated on the chicken. Marinade in the fridge for 2-6 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a medium sized bowl combine all the ingredients for the feta sauce and whisk until smooth and creamy. Store in the fridge until ready to use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the grill to 425 F. Grill for 25-30 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and edges are crispy and light brown (Cook time is variable as it depends on each grill).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serve with your choice of side!&lt;/li&gt;

I could tell I was sinking into a worst-case scenario mindset. As my mind started to race so did my heart, which in turn triggered my anxiety. I could tell my body was physically responding to what I was thinking and feeling. I knew that slowing down and focusing on my breath would help to reground me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I laid on my couch with one hand on my belly and the other on my heart, and I breathed. Slow breath in, slow breath out. I repeated some mantras in term releasing the fear, the weight, and breathed in truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep breathing did not always come naturally and if I am being honest it still takes a deliberate effort because we are not used to breathing deeply. It can be a little uncomfortable and takes a little bit of practice. I thought I would share some of the first steps that Harvard health recommends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit or lie down. First, take a normal breath. Then try a deep breath: Breathe in slowly through your nose, allowing your chest and lower belly to rise as you fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Now breathe out slowly through your mouth (or your nose, if that feels more natural).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if all you can do is a minute, take some time to take a deep breath today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="anxiety" /><summary type="html">The other day my mind started going all sorts of ways.

It is known as the stress response. It activates when stressed or in danger to keep us from harm. When fired in a dangerous situation, it helps us survive to live another day. Unfortunately, this response does not just happen if you are running from a tiger. It can be from our day to day events- our packed schedules and our worries. This can result in some of the health issues we are seeing today like high blood pressure, suppressed immune system, anxiety, and depression. In fact, a lot of my health issues were from my body being in a constant state of “fight or flight”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my journey of healing, something that has been crucial to getting my adrenals healthy again (the adrenal glands are triggered during stress) is slowing down and breathing, deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you paused and took a deep breath? Deep breathing is said to help combat issues like anxiety, stress, pain, high blood pressure, and even digestion problems. It literally evokes the relaxation response in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are feeling overwhelmed or stressed, just breath.&lt;/p&gt;

If so, you are going to love this no sugar added, vegan and paleo chocolate milk. It is naturally sweetened with dates, and is delicious in coffee. You also do not strain cashew milk which makes for an easy clean up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cashew Coconut Chocolate Milk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servings: 4-5 cups
Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup raw cashews soaked for at least four hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 unpitied dates soaked for 10 minutes (or more if you like it sweet)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¾ cup full fat coconut milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 ¼ cup filtered water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons cocoa powder (if you like it very chocolatey do more)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soak cashews in water for at least 4 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soak the dates for 10 minutes and discard the water.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drain and rinse the cashews and add all the ingredients to a high-speed blender.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blend until smooth and store in the refrigerator up to 5 days.
&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt; This is not a sweet chocolate milk, so if you like it sweet I would add more dates, or sub maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;

The uncertainty we are living in takes a toll on me. I have allowed myself to live in fear, to accept it as true, and allow it to seep into almost every aspect of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My anxiety worsened, self-hatred thoughts creeped in, and it just seems I am seeing everything through a lens of hopelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I was reminded to guard my heart, which means actually guarding it, by choosing what to let in. Just because I feel something does not mean I have to accept it. Yes, I feel fear, I feel hopelessness but I can choose not to accept it or to not agree with it. I can choose to not allow it to reign in my heart and in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are living in uncertain times. We do not know what tomorrow brings. There is much out of our control but let us focus on what we can control today. We can control what lens we are seeing from. We can choose to guard our hearts. We can choose to feel and not accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically, I think this can look different for everyone but for me, it is taking the time to understand why my heart or my mind is going to certain places. Then simply pausing and repeating what I know to be true and what I believe. It is getting in nature and out of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are living in uncertain times. How are you responding to the times we are living in? Are you living from a place of fear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends, let us not have a spirit of fear but one of love and self-control. Let us make deliberate intentions to choose hope.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><summary type="html">I do not know about you but lately my heart, soul, and honestly body feels heavy.

&lt;p&gt;Blueberry Lemon Muffins (vegan, gluten free, refined sugar free)
Servings: 8 muffins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients
Blueberry Muffins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup almond flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¾ cup gluten free oat flour (if using homemade make sure it is finely ground)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ tapioca flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons baking powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ teaspoon fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup full fat coconut milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ lemon zested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maple Lemon Butter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons grass-fed butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 teaspoons maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼- ½ teaspoon lemon zest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a muffin pan with cupcake liners.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a medium sized bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and lemon zest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a small bowl mix, together all the dry ingredients and add to the wet ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold in the blueberries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spoon the batter evenly into a cup or liner and bake for 20-25 minutes (mine took 22 minutes).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While the muffins are baking, mix together the butter, lemon and maple syrup until combined (can mix by hand or use an electric mixer).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serve the muffins with a dollop of maple lemon butter on top and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;

Anyone else? Seriously though, I think I love snacks because I am not limited to choosing one thing. I can have a little bit of everything. I thought I would share some of my favorite healthier options for snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple Mills Crackers- They have all kinds but I love the almond flour ones. They are paleo, vegan and real ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HU Kitchen - Chocolate bars without refined sugar? THE BEST. I use them for all my baking, or when I just need a little chocolate in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almond Butter- I love just about anything with almond butter but be mindful of what the ingredients are. I buy unsalted so mine is just almonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope Foods Hummus- A lot of hummus brands have high inflammatory oils in them. This brand uses just olive oil and is delish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Foods Queso- Non-dairy queso sold at Costco. I love to add it to roasted veggies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fruits &amp;amp; Veggies- Just make sure you are washing/soaking them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are small changes and a good way to enjoy snacking on real food. If you want to read more on mindful snacking, I shared a little more in a post a couple months ago. If you try them, let me know what you think or let me know some of your favorite snacks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="snacks" /><summary type="html">Crazy snack girl over here!

I am trying to be transparent in all areas of my life. Instagram can start to become a place where only the good things are caught on camera or shared in a post. However, I feel like I am struggling, like I know so many of us have, with the loss of Beau, not seeing my family, struggling to find my “purpose”, along with everything else going on. I felt lost and feel like I am living under water for a number of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I ponder the last few months and prepare for what the next couple could be, I realized many of my emotions have been “both and”. Let me explain a little. I think we have been taught it is either or. For example, you are either happy or sad, grateful or unappreciative. However, I feel both sad and joyful. It is possible to hold grief and joy, thankfulness and discontentment, in the same hand or to live in pain and also live in tremendous hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working on telling myself to ride whatever wave of emotion or emotions I am feeling. Today, I am extremely sad, overwhelmed, and confused but I am also hopeful and incredibly thankful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am struggling but in the struggle and the times of despair, I am reminded of the strength, the power and beauty that dwells within me. Life Is not just about the peaks. It is the chaos behind the picture, the slow Saturday mornings on the couch, or the tears shed from the loss of something or someone you loved. Life is hard, painful, beautiful, and it is worth the risk. To choose to love and live is to choose to lose and grieve. A life without pain and hardship is not a life at all.
