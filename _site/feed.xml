It can be easy to say it aloud but how do we practically live it out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, start with asking yourself why. Why am I reaching for a snack? Next, examine the answer. Is it I am I hungry? I am bored? I am upset and finding myself turning to food for comfort? Only you know the answers and what your body needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you understand your why, there are a few things to ensure mindful snacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I mindfully snack is by cutting and preparing my vegetables and fruit. After, I put it at eye level in the fridge. Anytime I open it the refrigerator, the first thing I see is easily accessible prepared veggies and fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Snacker” is in my DNA and honestly always will be. However, I need to moderate the amount I eat so I am not mindlessly consuming. I practice plating my snacks. Taking a whole bag of crackers to the couch to work on something or to watch TV never ends well. Plating my snacks sets me up to avoid overconsumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both tips are indeed simple. Tip Thursdays are all about small changes leading to big impacts down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some of the ways you are going to practice mindful snacking this week/weekend?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="mindfulness" /><category term="snacks" /><summary type="html">On Tuesday, I talked about eating how I want to feel.

&lt;p&gt;Greek Cucumber Salad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servings: 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cucumber diced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ - ¾ cup diced tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup crumbled feta (omit for paleo)&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Enjoy
&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt; I generally make it 2-4 hours before serving, it’s best to allow the flavors to marinate if time allows&lt;/li&gt;

Have you ever stopped to think about food in the context of feeling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you want to feel right now? Yes, we are at home more than usual. Yes, we are likely more scared, on edge, and trying to keep anxiety in check but how do you want to feel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would be remiss to put water and gasoline into your car and expect it to run smoothly at peak performance without issue. Garbage in. Garbage out. Why do I find myself always grabbing a bag of chips or ice cream and eating until it is gone? Eating a tub of ice cream may provide instant gratification but leaves an unpaid bill for later. Everything consumed affects mood, health, and relationships. If I want to feel energetic, clear minded, healthy, and active, I fuel my body with nutrient rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding our “why” is of the utmost important. Why do I want to eat healthy? Identify first how you want to feel (I assume we all want to feel exceptional) as it helps us understand our purpose and motivation moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am by no means saying I do not consume treats. Eat in moderation and accordance with how I want to feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, I am going to discussing snacking with mindfulness with the uptick in working from home. I will outline practical tips to put mindful snacking into motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you want to feel? Why do you want to feel that way? Are you eating how you want to feel? As you start to ask these questions, exercise grace with yourself (especially in the current circumstances).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><summary type="html">Do you eat how you want to feel?

Traditions like: going to church, enjoying a big meal with family and friends, or taking the kids to find Easter eggs. It all will look a little different this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself focusing too much on the “I wish”(s). I wish Easter could be like last year. I wish I could pick out a fun dress and go to church. I wish I could be with my family. I realized the negative state of mind served only to make matters worse. I decided to focus on the “I can”(s).  I can make the holiday special even under the current circumstances. I can still make a tasty meal. I can still share a meal with my family (via Facetime/Zoom/Skype/Other).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I challenge us to focus on what we can control rather than what we cannot control. I am still able to plan a fun menu for Easter dinner and find joy in it. I can still wear a dress as I watch church online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can you do to make this holiday special? Can you hide Easter eggs (or just little treasures if you do not have eggs) around the house for your kids to find? Can you make a special dessert? Can you Facetime loved ones while you are sitting around your table?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us choose joy and hope and focus on the “I can”(s). A change in our mindset from “I wish” to “I can” may seem small. Small changes lead to big impacts down the road. Let us shift our mindset and perspective during this time to be grateful for the things we can control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still much you can control and much to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="mindfulness" /><summary type="html">Easter is on Sunday and we might be a little sad to deviate from normal traditions.

Right now, many of our homes seem to become dirtier quicker than usual with more meals eaten at home and with an increase in activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like a deliberate and organized spot for everything. I regularly go through my clothes, drawers and cabinets to remove things I do not use. For me, it helps calm my anxiety and keep frustrations low. There are ample health benefits to living in a clean home to include lowering stress and fatigue, reducing allergy and asthma symptoms, and lessening the spread of germs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study from Indiana University found people with clean houses were healthier people. The study described house cleanliness as a better predictor for physical health than neighborhood walkability. Another study out of Princeton University found clutter can make it more difficult to focus on a particular task. Specifically, they found the visual cortex can be overwhelmed by task-irrelevant objects, which made it harder to allocate attention and complete tasks efficiently. The National Sleep foundation reported people who make their beds every morning are 19 percent more likely to report getting a good night sleep and 75 percent of people say they achieve a better night sleep with clean sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we are all home more, this a exceptional opportunity for us to spend some time deep cleaning and organizing the clutter. There is a lot in our lives we cannot control but we can control the cleanliness of our homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our best home purchases was a robot vacuum. Let me tell you – it is one of the best purchases we made in our marriage. We run it just about every day (and it always picks up more dust than we could imagine). I always clean the kitchen and run the dishwasher after making dinner because starting the day with a clean kitchen is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the year, I told myself I would go through every room, closet and drawer in the house. I generally do one a week with only a few bedrooms left. Deep cleaning can seem overwhelming to do it all at once so I break it up. I separate regular chores (like cleaning the bathrooms, vacuuming, laundry) from cleaning showers tubs, baseboards, fans, shutters etc. I tend to do my regular chores during the week and leave the other ones to about monthly. I try to keep the extra bedrooms to standard of cleanliness to allow friends to stop by on short notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this said, I do want to add to always be graceful with yourself. There have been times I did not complete what I hoped and that is alright. I think overall creating a standard of cleanliness helps set us up for success. Many of us are feeling more stressed and anxious than usual and cleanliness is one way that can help ease it. There is much we cannot control so let go of those areas and start focusing on what we can.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><category term="cleaning" /><category term="cleaning-products" /><summary type="html">I am known for a clean house because for me it creates a space of peace and calmness.

&lt;h4&gt;Tzatziki:&lt;/h4&gt;

                    &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons white wine vinegar&lt;/li&gt;

                    &lt;li&gt;½ teaspoon garlic powder&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon fresh dill (or ½ tablespoon dried dill)&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Dash of fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Marinade:&lt;/h4&gt;
                    &lt;ul class=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;li&gt;1-pound chicken thigh&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;¼ cup fresh lemon juice&lt;/li&gt;

  												&lt;li&gt;Add the chicken and marinade together in a bag and shake until the chicken is thoroughly coated in the marinade&lt;/li&gt;
  												&lt;li&gt;Marinade for 2-8 hours&lt;/li&gt;
  												&lt;li&gt;Grill chicken at indirect heat (400F/medium) until cooked through and serve with Tzatziki and serve with your favorite side (rice, cauliflower rice, or pita)&lt;/li&gt;

I struggled with anxiety since high school. Through the years and through many doctors, I learned about “Candida” which is a yeast overgrowth in my gut. Candida is said to cause anxiety and other symptoms. As I started to heal my gut, I found significant relief but there were still times when it would come back.
Although my anxiety subsided, it surged back with the passing of Beau and the uncertain time we are living in. I learned some techniques to combat the anxiety when it starts to take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Getting outside- Take a hike, walk, run, bike ride, or just sit on the porch. Being in nature helps reground me. Spring is still happening. The trees are still blooming and the birds are still chirping. It provides a sense of peace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aromatherapy - When my anxiety starts to run rapid, it is soothing to roll essential oil on my chest or just breath the smells in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray/Worship- For me, reminding myself of truth and the God I serve helps to tackle the feeling of “things are out of my control”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breathe Deep- Laying down and focusing solely on my breath allows tension and thoughts to dissipate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
