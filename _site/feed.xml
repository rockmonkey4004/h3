To be honest, last week was one of those weeks. It seemed like everything planned changed to a no. Everything I thought I had under control went sideways. I felt horrible, my face flared again, our beach trip did not happen, the dog we were wanting was possibly a no go, and the list continued beyond those things. It felt like one of those times when no matter what I did it was enough or right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not be enough for people around me and I could not give my body what it needed. Why was I having the reaction again? What did I do wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say I gave myself a pep talk and turned it all around in a day’s time. That is not the case but it is alright. I cried, I called the people I loved, I showed myself grace, and allowed myself to sit in the hardness, the sadness, and the disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 has been a tremendously hard year for me and probably most of us. I found in the hard seasons growth follows. Growth does not happen by skipping ahead or by trying to ignore the problem, or areas of hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Alaska, some of the rivers were considered braided rivers (one of just a handful of places in the world to have braided rivers). These rivers change with each season and are dynamic as they are continuously formed, consumed, and re-directed. The braided river beds are a natural representation of passing time, and re-direction fueled by what each season brings. I think growth comes when we allow pain and hardness to channel a new path, like the braided rivers, to redirect us in our thought process, redirect our goals, our motives, and our choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to gracefully re-direct, we need to allow ourselves to sit in it, to feel it, and to talk about it. I am not saying to allow it to define you but allow it to redirect you. Give yourself permission to sit in it. I truly believe growth and redirection will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How has the hardness of 2020 redirected you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sub applesauce for butter and/or oil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use flax eggs instead of eggs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use coconut sugar instead of cane/brown sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add collagen for some extra protein.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use less sugar- if I am following someone else’s recipe, I almost always can do less sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider using natural sweeteners- like dates, mashed bananas etc. For example, when I
make nut milk, I sweeten it with dates rather than maple syrup.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freeze half of the dough. Whenever I make cookies, I almost always freeze half the
dough to help with self-control and then you always have an easy dessert on hand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Half the recipe-limit the treats. If the recipe is not freezer friendly, I generally half it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some dessert recipes allow for flour subs- if so almond and oat flour are great. You can
also always keep a paleo all-purpose flour in your panty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you have not turned my chocolate cookies into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/02/28/paleo-chocolate-chip-cookies/&quot;&gt;cookie ice cream sandwich&lt;/a&gt;, do it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="desserts" /><summary type="html">Easy tips healthy swaps for desserts</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockmonkey/image/upload/v1598535256/Blog/ice-cream-sandwich_ytghlz.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockmonkey/image/upload/v1598535256/Blog/ice-cream-sandwich_ytghlz.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Pumpkin Spice Sauce</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/25/Pumpkin-Spice/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pumpkin Spice Sauce" /><published>2020-08-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-08-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/08/25/Pumpkin-Spice</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/25/Pumpkin-Spice/">&lt;p&gt;I woke up to Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) season even though it still feels like summer in Nashville!

&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin Spice Sauce (Paleo, Vegan, Refined Sugar Free)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servings: About 1 cup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup unsweetened nut milk of choice (I used homemade almond milk)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3aWISFq&quot;&gt;pumpkin puree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2YAkjcy&quot;&gt;maple syrup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3livGQ5&quot;&gt;coconut sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/31tt4a1&quot;&gt;pumpkin pie spice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ teaspoon fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a medium sized saucepan, add all the ingredients except vanilla extract on medium high heat. Whisk ingredients until smooth and when the sauce starts to bubble around the edges turn heat to low and let simmer for 8-12 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stir in the vanilla.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strain in a fine mesh strainer (you do not have to do this step it just makes it extra smooth).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow sauce to cool (it should thicken more as it does) and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servings: 10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 box of Simple Mills Brownie Mix&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 flax eggs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup melted coconut oil or melted grass-fed butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 Tablespoons unsweetened nut milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 Pint of Coconut Bliss Vanilla Ice Cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the oven to 375 F degrees and prepare a cookie sheet with parchment paper.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make flax eggs by combining 2 tablespoons of ground flax with 5 tablespoons boiling water.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whisk together and let sit for 10 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a medium sized bowl, combine the brownie mix, flax eggs, oil or butter and nut milk in a bowl and whisk until combined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spread evenly onto the cookie sheet until about ¼ - ½ inch thin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake for 15-20 minutes or cooked through (do not overcook, it will become crispy).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow to cool for 5 minutes on the pan and then cool completely on a wire rack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take ice cream out and let it soften for 10-15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut the brownies using a pizza cutter to cut four even rectangles. Take two of the brownie slices and apply as much ice cream as desired on top and spread evenly all over. Place the other two slices (the ones without the ice cream) on top and wrap in plastic wrap and freeze for an hour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take them out of the freezer and cut each into 4-5 squares, totaling to 8-10 ice cream sandwiches.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrap in plastic wrap and or foil and store in a freezer safe bag.&lt;/li&gt;

I just want to share a little more of my story by talking about how my IBS healed and the changes I made to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly wish I could say one thing, like food, on its own heals IBS but it is not the case. When I was in the thick of it, not able to eat much of anything, I needed to understand what was going on. I needed to stop diagnosing my symptoms and discover the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked about it before but my root cause for a lot of my health issues was parasites. Once I addressed my root cause, I started to see my health quality improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took almost a year to get rid of the parasites and almost five years to be where I am now health wise. In the beginning, I wanted an easy fix but what I now believe is true healing and addressing the root cause is not an easy fix but it is a lasting one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To aid in the healing, I made immense lifestyle adjustments, from diet, sleep, exercise, to learning how to manage my stress. Also, I took supplements and vitamins to help my body restore and replenish. I did colonics (still do) which is a colon cleanse to clear my body of the parasites. I conducted multiple natural parasite cleanses but I also did a strong antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healing is not one size fits all so the approach to medicine for disease should not be a one and done. I guarantee if I did not do a mix of things I would not be where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will admit there were times where taking a pain pill to finally ease the pain, or aid in sleep. It was not the ultimate answer. It did not actually help me feel better. In fact, I worsened. Yes, true healing is the harder choice. It means being your own advocate, choosing to make your own cookie instead of buying Oreos, or giving up the adrenaline rush from high intensity workouts to the slow pace of a walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were times these last couple years where giving up and only addressing my symptoms was much more appealing. I am so thankful I continue to fight for my health and for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this to say, sometimes the path to true healing is the less attractive choice because it requires change, commitment, and discipline. I can tell you it is worth it. You are worth it. Your body is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are struggling with irritable bowel, autoimmune disease, pain, fatigue, migraines, or any medical disease there is hope. You know your body best so be your own advocate. I know the journey feels long, impossible, disappointing but do not settle. You are worth it so show up for yourself, even when you do not want to because it is arduous. This girl felt horrible, overwhelmed and exhausted but I kept showing up for myself, I kept fighting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><summary type="html">First off - a quick disclaimer - I want to say I am in no way giving medical advice.

  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup avocado oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 lemon juiced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons Dijon mustard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ tablespoon honey (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon dried rosemary&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon garlic powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon onion powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon smoked paprika&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fresh ground pepper and fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feta Sauce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 tablespoons vegenaise (or regular mayo)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup chopped feta&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon red wine vinegar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon Italian seasoning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon garlic powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon onion powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ teaspoon red chili fakes (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fresh ground pepper and fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a large zip lock bag place the chicken and all the ingredients for the marinade. Close tightly and shake until marinade is mixed and evenly coated on the chicken. Marinade in the fridge for 2-6 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a medium sized bowl combine all the ingredients for the feta sauce and whisk until smooth and creamy. Store in the fridge until ready to use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the grill to 425 F. Grill for 25-30 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and edges are crispy and light brown (Cook time is variable as it depends on each grill).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serve with your choice of side!&lt;/li&gt;

It is easy to whip together and can be prepared the morning or afternoon before dinner. I love to serve it with a side of green beans and sweet potatoes but it would pair great with rice. I think grilled chicken thigh is just the best but you can also cook it on the stove stop.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockmonkey/image/upload/v1598394645/Blog/lemon-dijon-chicken_h8gm0z.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockmonkey/image/upload/v1598394645/Blog/lemon-dijon-chicken_h8gm0z.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Just Breathe</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/13/Thurs-Just-Breathe/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Just Breathe" /><published>2020-08-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-08-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/08/13/Thurs-Just-Breathe</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/13/Thurs-Just-Breathe/">&lt;p&gt;The other day my mind started going all sorts of ways. I could tell I was sinking into a worst-case scenario mindset. As my mind started to race so did my heart, which in turn triggered my anxiety. I could tell my body was physically responding to what I was thinking and feeling. I knew that slowing down and focusing on my breath would help to reground me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I laid on my couch with one hand on my belly and the other on my heart, and I breathed. Slow breath in, slow breath out. I repeated some mantras in term releasing the fear, the weight, and breathed in truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep breathing did not always come naturally and if I am being honest it still takes a deliberate effort because we are not used to breathing deeply. It can be a little uncomfortable and takes a little bit of practice. I thought I would share some of the first steps that Harvard health recommends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit or lie down. First, take a normal breath. Then try a deep breath: Breathe in slowly through your nose, allowing your chest and lower belly to rise as you fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Now breathe out slowly through your mouth (or your nose, if that feels more natural).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if all you can do is a minute, take some time to take a deep breath today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="anxiety" /><summary type="html">The other day my mind started going all sorts of ways.
