One of my all-time favorite side dishes is roasted butternut squash. Although, I sometimes opt for the already cubed butternut squash it is noticeably better if you buy it and chop it yourself.

&lt;p&gt;Roasted Butternut Squash
Servings: 4
Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 large butternut squash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2-4 Tablespoons avocado oil (depending on the size of squash)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 ½ teaspoons Primal Palate BBQ seasoning (or any BBQ seasoning)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon Italian Seasoning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sea Salt &amp;amp; Pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 400F.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut butternut squash into cubes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toss the everything in a bowl until butternut squash is fully coated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put butternut squash in a casserole dish (or cookie sheet with parchment paper)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bake for 50 mins - 1 hour or until the squash is golden and crispy on the edges.&lt;/li&gt;

Before we start, I think it is important to ponder what we need to let go of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take some time today or this weekend to reflect and journal some of the things/areas you want to let go of. As I started to list out mine, I was shocked with what I am still holding onto. After the first one, the ideas and thoughts kept on flowing. It was clear I needed to write it down. There is something healing about committing it to paper. It is a small step but a first step in letting go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TipThursdays are about small changes leading to big impacts down the road. I believe taking time to journal and actually write down things we need to let go of is an important step in taking back control of our thoughts. I talked about controlling what we can and releasing what we cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I will share an area I am letting go of and why. I hope you join me on this journey. Let us take back control over ourselves and let go of the areas keeping us captive and no longer serving us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="letting-go" /><summary type="html">On Tuesday, I shared about starting a series related to letting go.

&lt;p&gt;Letting go of control. Letting go of lies I believed. Letting go of things holding me captive. Letting go of clutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now until May, I am going to focus my #topictuesday and #tipthursdays on things I am practicing letting go. Every Tuesday (for this series) I will share my why and on Thursday I will outline practical ways of letting go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is beauty even in this season. Part of the beauty is the gift of time. I want to use this time to look deeper into my soul, spirit and heart. I want to actively be working towards the best version of myself. I desire to put habits into practice to carry over into all seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us practice letting go. There is freedom in removing the burdens shackling us down. Let us let go so we can fully walk in truth, lightness, and joy and run with endurance the path marked out for us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="mindfulness" /><category term="letting-go" /><summary type="html">If I narrowed down what I learned these past few weeks to one thing, it would be my need to let go.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/bridge-in-woods_wphgny.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/bridge-in-woods_wphgny.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mindful Snacking</title><link href="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/17/Thurs-Mindful-Snacking/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mindful Snacking" /><published>2020-04-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/17/Thurs-Mindful-Snacking</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/17/Thurs-Mindful-Snacking/">&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I talked about eating how I want to feel. It can be easy to say it aloud but how do we practically live it out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, start with asking yourself why. Why am I reaching for a snack? Next, examine the answer. Is it I am I hungry? I am bored? I am upset and finding myself turning to food for comfort? Only you know the answers and what your body needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you understand your why, there are a few things to ensure mindful snacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I mindfully snack is by cutting and preparing my vegetables and fruit. After, I put it at eye level in the fridge. Anytime I open it the refrigerator, the first thing I see is easily accessible prepared veggies and fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Snacker” is in my DNA and honestly always will be. However, I need to moderate the amount I eat so I am not mindlessly consuming. I practice plating my snacks. Taking a whole bag of crackers to the couch to work on something or to watch TV never ends well. Plating my snacks sets me up to avoid overconsumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both tips are indeed simple. Tip Thursdays are all about small changes leading to big impacts down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some of the ways you are going to practice mindful snacking this week/weekend?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="mindfulness" /><category term="snacks" /><summary type="html">On Tuesday, I talked about eating how I want to feel.

Have you ever stopped to think about food in the context of feeling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you want to feel right now? Yes, we are at home more than usual. Yes, we are likely more scared, on edge, and trying to keep anxiety in check but how do you want to feel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would be remiss to put water and gasoline into your car and expect it to run smoothly at peak performance without issue. Garbage in. Garbage out. Why do I find myself always grabbing a bag of chips or ice cream and eating until it is gone? Eating a tub of ice cream may provide instant gratification but leaves an unpaid bill for later. Everything consumed affects mood, health, and relationships. If I want to feel energetic, clear minded, healthy, and active, I fuel my body with nutrient rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding our “why” is of the utmost important. Why do I want to eat healthy? Identify first how you want to feel (I assume we all want to feel exceptional) as it helps us understand our purpose and motivation moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am by no means saying I do not consume treats. Eat in moderation and accordance with how I want to feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, I am going to discussing snacking with mindfulness with the uptick in working from home. I will outline practical tips to put mindful snacking into motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you want to feel? Why do you want to feel that way? Are you eating how you want to feel? As you start to ask these questions, exercise grace with yourself (especially in the current circumstances).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><summary type="html">Do you eat how you want to feel?

Traditions like: going to church, enjoying a big meal with family and friends, or taking the kids to find Easter eggs. It all will look a little different this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself focusing too much on the “I wish”(s). I wish Easter could be like last year. I wish I could pick out a fun dress and go to church. I wish I could be with my family. I realized the negative state of mind served only to make matters worse. I decided to focus on the “I can”(s).  I can make the holiday special even under the current circumstances. I can still make a tasty meal. I can still share a meal with my family (via Facetime/Zoom/Skype/Other).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I challenge us to focus on what we can control rather than what we cannot control. I am still able to plan a fun menu for Easter dinner and find joy in it. I can still wear a dress as I watch church online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can you do to make this holiday special? Can you hide Easter eggs (or just little treasures if you do not have eggs) around the house for your kids to find? Can you make a special dessert? Can you Facetime loved ones while you are sitting around your table?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us choose joy and hope and focus on the “I can”(s). A change in our mindset from “I wish” to “I can” may seem small. Small changes lead to big impacts down the road. Let us shift our mindset and perspective during this time to be grateful for the things we can control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still much you can control and much to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="mindfulness" /><summary type="html">Easter is on Sunday and we might be a little sad to deviate from normal traditions. Traditions like: going to church, enjoying a big meal with family and friends, or taking the kids to find Easter eggs. It all will look a little different this year.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/dogwood-blooms_pilblc.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/dogwood-blooms_pilblc.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
