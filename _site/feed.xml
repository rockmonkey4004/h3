It is a fantastic way to up your taco game and avoid store bought salsa loaded with extra ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 small/medium sized roma tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 habaneros&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 jalapenos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ yellow onion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sliced red pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 lime juiced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handful of cilantro&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start grill and preheat to 350-400F (We use apple wood chips to give a complementary smoke flavor)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slice and deseed the habaneros, jalapenos, red pepper (Pro tip – put on latex/nitrile gloves for handling peppers)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chop onion in half and then in quarters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add roma tomatoes, sliced habaneros, jalapenos, red pepper and onion onto a grill safe pan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grill at indirect heat at 350-400F until the red pepper edges are slighting brown / black and the skin of the tomatoes should start to peel off&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove skin from the Roma tomatoes and add all the ingredients from the grill to a food processor. Add fresh lime juice, cilantro and sea salt and pulse until it has reached your desired consistency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store in an airtight container and refrigerate salsa for at least 2 hours before serving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I improved my wellbeing was by avoiding the scale. I used to go on it two/three times per week. Now, I only went on it once the last three/four months. Muscle weighs more than fat. When I start to exercise, specifically weightlifting, I gain weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A normal scale does not tell you if you gained muscle or not. One thing I have found helpful is use the scale at my doctor’s office. It measures your muscle per leg, arms, etc., and also computes overall fat and muscle percentages. It allows me to see my progress and my overall health compared to a number on a scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may sound easier than it is but listening to my body resulted in mindset shift. My body never lies. Yet somehow when my body tells me it is tired and needs to slow down I like to push it further. I do this with exercise but used to do it with food and alcohol. If I did not sleep well and my body was begging for rest, I indulged in things like caffeine and sugar to help give me a boost. On days of stress and feeling overwhelmed, I consumed too many glasses of alcohol to make it go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to my body in regards to exercise can look different depending on the day. It can be resting on a day I planned to run. It can also be getting off the couch when I want to veg out. This morning on my run I wanted to run six miles, but I was running faster than normal and by mile four I knew my body was asking me to slow down. I decided to walk for a minute and then ran again. I ran another mile when I realized I did not need to push my body any harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few helpful ways to change my perspective when it comes to exercise but I am not perfect. There are still days I want to jump on the scale and force myself to go just a little heavier or a little longer. I gently remind myself of my overall goal: health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some of the things you can practically do to help change your perspective on exercising for wellbeing?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="letting-go" /><category term="exercise" /><summary type="html">For #topictuesday, I shared about letting go of exercising for weight loss and exercise for my overall wellbeing.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/gps-watch-data_gqp530.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/gps-watch-data_gqp530.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Letting Go Series (Exercise for Weightloss)</title><link href="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/05/12/Letting-Go-Series-Exercise-Weightloss/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Letting Go Series (Exercise for Weightloss)" /><published>2020-05-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://h3withlaura.com/2020/05/12/Letting-Go-Series-Exercise-Weightloss</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/05/12/Letting-Go-Series-Exercise-Weightloss/">&lt;p&gt;There have been times in my life where I exercised simply to lose weight. The harder I worked in the gym, the more I hoped to see come off the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony for me was the harder I worked out the more weight I gained and the less I worked out the more weight I lost. I know it is not the case for everyone. During the time where I would push my body to the limits by going to the gym a couple hours a day almost every day, I pushed it too far and did not listening to what my body was saying. I needed rest to recover and I never allowed my body the rest. Sadly, I fixated on seeing my number on the scale go down, and I did not care to notice how bad I hurt my body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I hit the point where I could not do anything and allowed my body to rest and heal, I began to lose the weight. I know my story is probably unlike most but I do think most can relate. Are you exercising to lose weight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I have found the important of exercise for my health, both physically and mentally. It is easy to feel let down after working hard at the gym (or in this case my garage) and not seeing the desired results. Exercise produces results beyond what we can see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise results in profound positive impacts on depression, anxiety, ADHD, stress and can improve memory, boost overall mood and much more. For me, regular exercise gives a sense of wellbeing. I have more energy, more confidence, I sleep better at night and overall, and I just feel better about myself and life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing all that, why is it still so easy to feel frustrated and unmotivated as soon as I step on the scale? On #tipthursday, I am going to share how I battled the feelings and emotions and share ways which helped me let go of exercising for weight loss. I flipped the mindset and started exercising for my wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My challenge is to exercise for wellbeing. Changing our mindset from exercising strictly to lose weight to exercising because it is good for our body, soul, and mind. I am not saying a goal to lose weight is bad but I think we will see more positive results both mentally, emotionally, and physically if we exercise for our wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about some of the positive affects you have seen from exercise not related to weight or physical results. Maybe you found a community or ground of friends. Maybe it brought self-confidence. Maybe it allowed you to enjoy a hike with your family. Whatever it is, rest in those positive effects and gratitude for your body - not for what it could be, or you hope it to be but for what it is right now and all it has done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><category term="letting-go" /><category term="exercise" /><summary type="html">There have been times in my life where I exercised simply to lose weight.

It turned out so yummy, I could not wait to share it with you! If you do not have strawberries on hand, no worries as any berries will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servings: 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strawberry Filling
Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 ½ cup chopped strawberries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ cup honey (or maple syrup)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 ½ tablespoons arrowroot powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 ½ tablespoons lemon juice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ teaspoon cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topping&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup gluten free oats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7 tablespoons softened grass-fed butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup almond flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup chopped pecans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/3 cup coconut sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 350 F.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add chopped strawberries, honey, arrowroot, lemon juice and cinnamon to a 9 by 9 square pan and stir until combined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a medium size bowl stir together the oats, almond flour, pecans, coconut sugar, vanilla extract and salt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add in softened butter and stir until combined (can use a hand mixer but I always use my hands).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the topping mixture to the strawberry filling and spread it out evenly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the filling is bubbling around the edges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enjoy with vanilla ice cream!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared a little about how important keeping a clean house is for me. During our time at home in these unusual times, we decided to go through everything we own. Living minimally has always sparked my interest but not something I fully understood or practiced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We listened to a podcast with a guest named Joshua Becker and he defined minimalism as “The intentional promotion of the things I most value in life by removing anything that distracts me from it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shared the goal of minimalism is not about owning the fewest stuff but about pursuing our greatest values and desires with more passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed to figure out what we valued most. For us, it is about experience, the time and financial freedom to do so. We realized we were spending time and money taking care of our stuff, when we would rather be experiencing, traveling, hiking, and having friends over. For example, there is stuff we moved from AK to OK to TN where we did not even open the box. We spent time figuring out where to store those boxes in each residence and money moving them across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one ever looks back on their life thankful for their stuff or the things they bought. I want to make sure that I am able to passionately pursue my hobbies and desires to the fullest. For us, it means removing the things we do not use and practice mindfulness when we purchase something. It is about quality not quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean I only have 10 pieces of clothing or have nothing on the walls. I am choosing to be intentional about what we keep in our house and what we purchase. I free up mental space if I can walk into my closet and know all the items fit and I will wear them. Ultimately, I want to spend my free time exploring and experiencing. It is mentally and physically taxing to clean, organize, maintain, and tend to things which do not advance my goal of an experience driven lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For #tipthursday, I am going to share how we practically are doing this. It is not something done in a week. It can take months. It is also not a one and done but a lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything you can let go of? Are there clothes, decorations, or kitchen items taking up space physically but also emotionally and mentally? What are your greatest values and desires? Are you setting yourself up for success by creating time, space and energy in order to pursue them?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><category term="letting-go" /><category term="cleaning" /><category term="mindfulness" /><summary type="html">Continuing with the “Letting Go” series, one of the areas I felt I needed to let go of is unused stuff.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/living-minimally_c2avap.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/living-minimally_c2avap.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Letting Go Series (I Am Enough - Part 2)</title><link href="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/30/Thurs-I-Am-Enough-Cont/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Letting Go Series (I Am Enough - Part 2)" /><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/30/Thurs-I-Am-Enough-Cont</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/30/Thurs-I-Am-Enough-Cont/">&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I shared about speaking truth into my life and letting go of the lies. One of the biggest lies I allowed in is that I am not enough. If you want to read more about how and why head to my &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/04/28/Tues-I-Am-Enough&quot;&gt;#topictuesday post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in letting go of anything is acknowledgment. What is the next step? How do I practically let go of that lie and live in the truth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it is making sure I am feeding my body, soul and spirit with truth and love. Personally, I wake up and spend time in God’s Word. It grounds me in truth and allows time for reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest in the truth and free the lies. It is a simple concept but requires an arduous effort to master. Do you recognize when shame starts to creep in? It is help to analyze what you are listening to and where your thoughts are taking you. Evaluate your actions and then act. Do not rest in shame, or lies. Shift your mindset and perspective into truth. It may mean taking a minute to breath or verbalize aloud positive self-talk. It may mean reaching out to your spouse or loved one and asking them to pray for you or speak into the lie or situation. It may also mean taking time and reflecting. Anchoring your identity, purpose, and relationships in the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talk a lot about understanding our why. Why do I feel like I am not enough? Why have I allowed shame to shape so much of my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be vulnerable. Open up those closets you keep shut. Open up to yourself, to a friend, or your partner. Vulnerability creates vulnerability. It brings light and truth into the darkness and lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My challenge to you is rest in the truth and free the lies. How we do that may look different for all of us. What are some of the ways you can live in the truth and free the lies?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="letting-go" /><summary type="html">On Tuesday, I shared about speaking truth into my life and letting go of the lies.

&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, I have been a number of sizes in my life. For so long, I believed when I lost the weight I would feel like I was enough. However, as I lost the weight, I began to realize the lie went much deeper than what showed on the outside. When I took my season of rest, it happened right after our wedding and moved away from all my family and friends. I went from loved ones around me, a full-time job, actively involved in a church, and going to school to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was heavier, I overcompensated by doing more and trying to being more. I busied myself by finding my worth in what I did. Fast forward to my season of rest where I started losing weight without trying but I had no one. No friends, no schedule, and no activities. As I felt like I was not enough in one area, I tried extra hard in the another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now looking back on both seasons and living my current one, where I am healthy, I still struggle with not being enough. Here I am healthy but I am not working. I have been married for four years but do not have children. How do I answer when someone asks what I do? I feel guilty because I know it is a privilege to not work and focus on my health but it can also be extremely lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circumstances change. They always will. Do I put my worth in my circumstances? In what I am doing today? In what I look like today? If I did, it would be fleeting. I would not be setting myself up for success but rather disappoint and failure because life is ever changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still learning, growing, processing and practicing how to control my thoughts around this by actively pushing out the lie and speaking truth. I am enough, not because of what I do or what I look like. I am enough because I believe I am enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple weeks, I am going to list more specific ways of letting go. I have to continue to rid my life of this lie and rest in the truth. For #tipthursday, I am going to share how I am practically doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

One of my all-time favorite side dishes is roasted butternut squash. Although, I sometimes opt for the already cubed butternut squash it is noticeably better if you buy it and chop it yourself. It is worth the effort, trust me.

  &lt;li&gt;1 large butternut squash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2-4 Tablespoons avocado oil (depending on the size of squash)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 ½ teaspoons Primal Palate BBQ seasoning (or any BBQ seasoning)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon Italian Seasoning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sea Salt &amp;amp; Pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 400F.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut butternut squash into cubes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toss the everything in a bowl until butternut squash is fully coated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put butternut squash in a casserole dish (or cookie sheet with parchment paper)&lt;/li&gt;

I love to use any leftovers we have on salad, my favorite being my “Burger Up House Salad”.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/roasted-butternut-squash_iz8eds.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/roasted-butternut-squash_iz8eds.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Letting Go (Series - Part 1)</title><link href="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/23/Thurs-Letting-Go-Part-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Letting Go (Series - Part 1)" /><published>2020-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/23/Thurs-Letting-Go-Part-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/23/Thurs-Letting-Go-Part-1/">&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I shared about starting a series related to letting go. Before we start, I think it is important to ponder what we need to let go of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take some time today or this weekend to reflect and journal some of the things/areas you want to let go of. As I started to list out mine, I was shocked with what I am still holding onto. After the first one, the ideas and thoughts kept on flowing. It was clear I needed to write it down. There is something healing about committing it to paper. It is a small step but a first step in letting go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TipThursdays are about small changes leading to big impacts down the road. I believe taking time to journal and actually write down things we need to let go of is an important step in taking back control of our thoughts. I talked about controlling what we can and releasing what we cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I will share an area I am letting go of and why. I hope you join me on this journey. Let us take back control over ourselves and let go of the areas keeping us captive and no longer serving us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="letting-go" /><summary type="html">On Tuesday, I shared about starting a series related to letting go.

&lt;p&gt;Letting go of control. Letting go of lies I believed. Letting go of things holding me captive. Letting go of clutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now until May, I am going to focus my #topictuesday and #tipthursdays on things I am practicing letting go. Every Tuesday (for this series) I will share my why and on Thursday I will outline practical ways of letting go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is beauty even in this season. Part of the beauty is the gift of time. I want to use this time to look deeper into my soul, spirit and heart. I want to actively be working towards the best version of myself. I desire to put habits into practice to carry over into all seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us practice letting go. There is freedom in removing the burdens shackling us down. Let us let go so we can fully walk in truth, lightness, and joy and run with endurance the path marked out for us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><category term="mindfulness" /><category term="letting-go" /><summary type="html">If I narrowed down what I learned these past few weeks to one thing, it would be my need to let go.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/bridge-in-woods_wphgny.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/bridge-in-woods_wphgny.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
