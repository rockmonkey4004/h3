  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 ½ cups &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CLLV2D0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00CLLV2D0&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=h3withlaura-20&amp;amp;linkId=95d673b6047b5d309c17d3e4b4fdb312&quot;&gt;almond flour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon baking powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a stand mixer combine butter, coconut sugar, maple syrup and vanilla extract and beat on medium high for 5 minutes until light and creamy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine all the dry ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the dry ingredients to the wet and beat only until mixed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put a piece of plastic wrap down and form dough into a ball and place it on top of the plastic wrap. Add another piece on top and flatten the dough into about a 1 inch thick rectangle. Place in the fridge for 4 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll out the dough into a ¼ inch thick rectangle in between two pieces of parchment paper. Using a pizza cutter cut in half horizontally, and then two vertically (should be six rectangles). Then lightly press with the pizza cutter and cut each rectangle into quarters (do not cut all the way through).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake at 325 degrees F for 12-17 minutes (mine took about 15) .&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow to cool for 30 minutes on a wire rack and turn the oven on 200 degrees F and place the wire rack in the oven for an hour to an hour and half.*&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store in an airtight container for a couple weeks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tips&quot;&gt;Tips&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not tried this with vegan butter, but if you are vegan and want to try it I recommend a stick of butter, not the spreadable kind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a Friday morning and I was waiting for my coffee to brew when I felt the little bumps on my forehead. I immediately started to cry. I knew that the bumps were just the beginning and soon my whole face was going to be broken out in what looks like cystic acne. Growing up, I took a lot of pride in my skin. It was what people complimented on. It started to become my idol. I thought, “I may not be able to be skinny, but at least I have good skin”. It seemed like the one thing I could count on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am for the second time, with a horrible skin rash and my immediate thought jumped to how unlovable I was. For so long, my skin is what I found my beauty and my worth it. I know it may sound silly but it is true. I tried everything to control breaking out in another reaction. I  changed all my skin care, remained on high alert to the food I was eating, and yet it happened again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a pattern in my journey: one of loss and surrender. For a year, I spent my life in bed. I gave up pretty much every food item that used to be a favorite. I have not held a traditional job since graduating college and I have given up relationships and time. I surrendered what I desired and wanted for my life: from where we live to what my day to day looks like. Nothing about my life is what I thought or what I wanted. I have lived in both complete trust I am in God’s hand and if I have to think of another day like today it may just be the end of me. Remember the “both and” I shared about? My story has been one of “both and”. It has been both hard and joyful; painful and beautiful; devastating and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could sit here and tell you I discovered why I was having the skin reaction and I feel better. I am still processing, maybe for the first time, the toll that this journey has had on me. In all honesty, I feel completely and totally exhausted. Worn out from the constant stress and awareness of my health and from the fear of what is going to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fought, everyday for the past 7 years to feel better, to stay better but now I need to believe I actually can get there. Yes, I may never feel perfect, because I am human, but I do not need to live in this lie that I will never feel good. That the work, and the sacrifices are for nothing, as they are not. I have seen tremendous healing, and SO much good comes from this journey. Remind yourself today that the sacrifices, the pain, is not for nothing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="mindfulness" /><category term="topic-tuesday" /><category term="anxiety" /><summary type="html">Topic Tuesday: Skin Journey Part 2</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockmonkey/image/upload/v1603996924/Blog/Skin_Journey_Part_2_fvneuv.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockmonkey/image/upload/v1603996924/Blog/Skin_Journey_Part_2_fvneuv.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Apple Hazelnut Salad</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/10/22/Apple-Hazelnut-Salad/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Apple Hazelnut Salad" /><published>2020-10-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/10/22/Apple-Hazelnut-Salad</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/10/22/Apple-Hazelnut-Salad/">&lt;p&gt;I made this salad last week and fell in love.

Since then, I had another flare-up which honestly felt like a little more than I could handle at the time. The first time it occurred we thought it was from a supplement I was taking. For this one, I had been off the supplement for about a month. We realized it could not have been the root cause and something else must be causing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to my previous health issues, when something new health-wise happens, it brings up significant angst and trepidation. I try to share the positive in everything but there have been some really dark times on my journey. Days when I questioned what the point of living or nights where my friends were out having fun and I was crying myself to sleep because of the pain and anxiety from not knowing what was wrong. The years of working my butt off in the gym and watching what I ate to see the number on the scale continue to increase. The fear over food as I struggled with whether my stomach could tolerate something. All of these things: the pain, the worry, the stress, the anxiety, and the depression do not go away. I have spent most of my adult life not feeling well. The effects of the mental, physical, spiritual and emotional taxation were real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When something seemingly little, like a skin reaction happens, a lot is brought up in both my heart and mind: the fear and what if’s. The thought of will it ever go away? What did I do wrong? Am I just destined to never be well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is balance for me. I must allow myself to feel but not allow my view of myself to shape, drive, and control me. I can be deceived by feelings, feelings of unworthiness, hopeless, and that I am unlovable. I can sit in the dark, the despair, the sadness and sometimes I allow myself to sit in it too long. Luckily, life keeps giving me ways to continue to practice how I can live in the frustration, sadness, and the truth. The truth that yes this is hard but it will not destroy me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe today you are finding yourself living in the darkness: the what if’s, the worst case scenarios, the lies that you are not enough, or this is forever. I just want to encourage you to find light because there is hope. Yes, there is a time and need to lament but do not park yourself in hopelessness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="mindfulness" /><category term="topic-tuesday" /><category term="anxiety" /><summary type="html">Some of you may remember me sharing about my rosacea flareup a couple months ago.

&lt;p&gt;Ready in 40 minutes
Servings 25 cookies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8 tablespoons grass-fed butter or vegan butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 ½ cups &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://amzn.to/39mBvoz&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1602639214579000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHf4o5jZHjIL1cV4nrDbOJYGgwHXQ&quot;&gt;coconut sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup unsweetened almond milk*&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 cups &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FUI7GNK/ref%3Das_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dh3withlaura-20%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB01FUI7GNK%26linkId%3D6d6e641b6a50623abf5739abf1eb4c3&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1602639259855000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG6YmbJLuUQDeuPdUkb6RfgXUL3DQ&quot;&gt;gluten free old fashioned oats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ cup cashew butter*&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¼ teaspoon fine sea salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Line a large cookie sheet with wax paper.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a medium saucepan, over medium high heat, add butter, coconut sugar, almond milk and cocoa powder and bring it to a boil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stir to help the butter melt. Once it starts to boil (bubbles all around), let boil for 1 minute.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove from heat and immediately add in the oats, cashew butter, and vanilla extract mixing until combined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working fast,  using a quarter inch cookie scoop, scoop the dough on the cookie sheet and set in the fridge for 30 minutes before eating (if you want flatter cookies, flatten the cookie with a spatula)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store in an airtight container in the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I had no clue what he meant and felt very overwhelmed when he told me all the things I needed to stay away from. I thought, &lt;em&gt;what the heck am I supposed to eat, grass?&lt;/em&gt;
It felt like everything in my (well my parents’ - I was in college at the time) pantry and fridge was no longer edible. I stood in the kitchen with the pantry door and fridge opened and cried. Not only did I feel absolutely horrible, in pain, and fatigued, now I needed to change how I ate?
If you are finding yourself in a similar place, I just want you to know that I understand, I see your pain, I see your frustration but I also see hope and know that lifestyle changes like what we eat can bring healing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paleo diet, also known as the caveman diet, focuses on nutrient-dense food that nourishes our bodies. It promotes optimum health by reducing inflammation and balancing blood sugar. It does this by avoiding processed and high inflammatory foods and focusing on primarily plant-based foods. Examples include vegetables, fruits, nuts, roots, grass-fed meats, fish and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really dislike calling it the paleo diet, because for me this has become my way of eating. It is not a diet for me, but a lifestyle. My hope in sharing this with you is that it will be helpful and educational in understanding why paleo is a great lifestyle and to encourage you, walk with you and support you in your journey of finding health, healing and hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-eat&quot;&gt;What To Eat:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vegetables&quot;&gt;Vegetables:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have long treated vegetables as a side with a meal. The goal with paleo is an array of fresh vegetables as the &lt;em&gt;foundation of your meal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fruit&quot;&gt;Fruit:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit is a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth. And as your body adjusts to not eating refined sugar, fruit will start to taste like candy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;meat--fish&quot;&gt;Meat &amp;amp; Fish:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein is a big part of the paleo diet, but I am not talking bacon. Stick with grass-fed, good quality organic meats. Wild game and fish are really great as well as free range eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuts--nut-butters&quot;&gt;Nuts &amp;amp; Nut Butters:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another good source of protein and fat. You may wonder why peanut butter is not paleo, and that is because it is actually a legume. If you want something to dip your apple in, stick with a nut butter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;healthy-fats&quot;&gt;Healthy Fats:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fat is crucial in this diet, but not just grass-fed butter. Good oils, like olive, avocado, coconut and tahini are great. I personally eat grass-fed butter and many other on the paleo diet do as well, but grass-fed ghee is also a great option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sweeteners&quot;&gt;Sweeteners:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although any type of sugar should be consumed conservatively, you can still use some natural sweeteners. Some adhering to paleo, especially for health reasons, choose to stay away from sweeteners altogether. But like most things in life, just remember moderation is key. Coconut sugar, date sugar, maple syrup and raw honey are all allowed on the paleo diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drinks&quot;&gt;Drinks:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water, water, water. Although you can have more than just water, four out of five Americans are not drinking enough water, so drink up. Tea, coffee, bone broth, unsweetened sparkling water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alcohol&quot;&gt;Alcohol:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, those who are strict paleo avoid alcohol. Beer is made from grains so contains gluten and liquor can also have trace amounts of gluten in it as well. But both hard cider and red wine are more accepted in the paleo community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-avoid&quot;&gt;What To Avoid:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grains - oats, rice, quinoa, corn, rye, wheat (gluten)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beans &amp;amp; Legumes - beans, lentils, tofu, soy foods, peanuts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dairy products&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refined salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trans fats - sunflower oil, peanut oil, canola oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soda &amp;amp; Fruit Juices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refined Sugars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refined meats - sausage and bacon, which contain other additives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Processed foods - chips, crackers, cookies, cereal, anything with refined sugar, refined salt, refined vegetable oils and artificial sweeteners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added preservatives and chemicals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-meals&quot;&gt;Example Meals:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;breakfast-&quot;&gt;Breakfast-&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smoothie- using frozen fruit, kale/spinach adding in a good fat like almond butter or avocado with a paleo protein powder or collagen with an unsweetened nut milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Egg scramble- scramble your eggs with some ghee or avocado oil, add some spinach, red pepper or any other veggies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a crust less quiche- eggs, nut milk, veggies and sweet potato’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/02/24/yogurt-bowls/&quot;&gt;Yogurt Bowl&lt;/a&gt;- make your own or find a paleo friendly option and tops with nuts, unsweetened coconut, nut butter and fruit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lunch-&quot;&gt;Lunch-&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Salads- lettuce, veggies, pumpkin seeds and an olive oil and balsamic dressing. My personal favorite is a cucumber tomato &lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/17/greek-salad/&quot;&gt;Greek salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lettuce wraps- use leftover meat and add your favorite sandwich toppings like homemade mayo, mustard, pickles, tomato etc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soup- make a chili but instead of adding beans add sweet potato’s, carrots, red pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leftovers- do you have some leftover sweet potato’s and chicken from the night before? Throw it on some lettuce and make a dressing and boom, done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/06/23/chicken-salad/&quot;&gt;Chicken salad&lt;/a&gt;- Find some avocado mayo or make your own and add shredded chicken, grapes and nuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;snacks&quot;&gt;Snacks:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apple &amp;amp; almond butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Homemade &lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/03/27/granola-bars/&quot;&gt;granola bars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Veggies &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/05/15/fire-roasted-salsa-applewood/&quot;&gt;salsa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/10/banana-bread/&quot;&gt;Homemade banana bread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paleo friendly snacks- depending on how strict you need to be or want to be, there are really great packaged snacks. Like these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CI3TADE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01CI3TADE&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=h3withlaura-20&amp;amp;linkId=21e061c78a4bd35453e429d834222eb6&quot;&gt;crackers&lt;/a&gt; and these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NP4SLP6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07NP4SLP6&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=h3withlaura-20&amp;amp;linkId=f3aa4e75b624553026d95fdcd53fe4c8&quot;&gt;chips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dinner-&quot;&gt;Dinner-&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grilled chicken, salad, &lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/24/roasted-butternut-squash/&quot;&gt;roasted butternut squash&lt;/a&gt; and veggies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big salad &lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/03/06/burger-up-salad/&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;, just omit the cheese and add roasted chicken&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/03/greek-tzatziki/&quot;&gt;Greek bowls&lt;/a&gt;- grilled chicken, a yummy sauce, cauliflower rice and grilled veggies makes for a filling and flavorful dinner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taco Bowls- use ground turkey and taco spices, add salsa, chopped tomato, cauliflower rice and romaine lettuce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/07/10/feta-kale-turkey-burgers/&quot;&gt;Turkey burgers&lt;/a&gt; with roasted sweet potatoes or Yukon potatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dessert-&quot;&gt;Dessert-&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending where you are on your journey, there are many great dessert options. You do not have to miss out on holiday and family traditions nor do you have to sacrifice taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/02/28/paleo-chocolate-chip-cookies/&quot;&gt;Chocolate chip cookies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cake- I mean we all want to be able to have a birthday cake right? There are many paleo recipes out there, but here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/06/26/funfetti-cake/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; that is easy and delicious&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/07/03/fudgy-brownies/&quot;&gt;Brownies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fruit crisp- one of my all-time favorite desserts is crisp. &lt;a href=&quot;https://h3withlaura.com/2020/05/08/strawberry-pecan-crisp/&quot;&gt;My recipe&lt;/a&gt; uses oats, but can easily be subbed for chopped nuts. Otherwise there are so many great options out there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apple nachos- Slice up some apples, melt some paleo friendly dark chocolate and add a nut butter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this has been helpful. Depending on what your body needs, you may need to be strict, or you may not need to be. There have been seasons where I have consumed no added sugar, no paleo packaged snacks.  But because I have adapted to a paleo lifestyle I do my best to not restrict myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, diets have not worked for me but becoming paleo was one of the best decisions I have made. Since I started paleo approximately 5 years ago, I have been able to tolerate and reintegrate certain foods back into my diet (for example goat and sheep cheeses). No journey is the same, so take the time to understand what your body needs and what is going to help you reach your optimum health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that living a paleo lifestyle is not only going to help your body heal, but you will feel better than before. My goal with H3 is to encourage people on their journey of health, healing and hope. I also desire to provide recipes that not only make you feel better but give you the same nostalgic feeling that your mom’s cinnamon rolls on Christmas morning do. I have learned that being paleo does not mean missing out, it actually means living life healthier and more abundantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you are not struggling with health issues or have seen healing, paleo is a great lifestyle for the 80/20 rule. Incorporate some paleo recipes, stay away from high inflammatory foods during the week and enjoy a night out with friends on the weekend. A change in lifestyle will set you up for more success than a diet will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time I stayed away from all legumes which meant I needed to make a beanless chili. Even though I am able to tolerate some beans now, this is hands down my favorite chili. It just has the best flavor, is full of great ingredients and is ready in under an hour!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready in 60 minutes
Serves 6 people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K4QF4HO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=h3withlaura-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00K4QF4HO&amp;amp;linkId=47d2f2b20f4aed10c63c96188c3f1ca1&quot;&gt;avocado oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 yellow squash chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 red pepper chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sweet potato diced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 medium yellow onion finely chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 pound ground turkey*&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 ½ tablespoons chili powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons cumin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009324C0U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=h3withlaura-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B009324C0U&amp;amp;linkId=75e1a167c9eec7736b87373055baef54&quot;&gt;coconut sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoons garlic powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon fine sea salt (or to taste)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fresh ground pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MRGWG9V/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=h3withlaura-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01MRGWG9V&amp;amp;linkId=ef268d4e97213abda22451df21ea0b72&quot;&gt;Rao’s marinara sauce&lt;/a&gt; or tomato sauce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup chicken broth (or more if you like a thinner chili)*&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dash of Cayenne pepper (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a large soup pan, over medium high heat, add the avocado oil,  onion, red pepper, and sweet potato and sauté for 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add in ground turkey and yellow squash.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Break the ground turkey apart with a spoon and cook for 5 minutes or until it is browned.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add all the seasonings and stir until well combined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the broth and marinara sauce, stirring until combined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce to a low medium simmer for 30 minutes (lid off), stirring occasionally.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enjoy it with your favorite toppings!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tips&quot;&gt;Tips&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make vegan, use your choice of beans ( I like black and navy beans) and vegetable broth
If you want the chili to simmer for longer, put the heat on low&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura Sanders</name></author><category term="recipes" /><category term="gluten-free" /><category term="egg-free" /><category term="paleo" /><category term="dinner" /><category term="favorite-recipes" /><summary type="html">I love chili because I am a toppings girl.
