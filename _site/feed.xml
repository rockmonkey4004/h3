One of the biggest lies I allowed in is that I am not enough. If you want to read more about how and why head to my &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/04/28/Tues-I-Am-Enough&quot;&gt;#topictuesday post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in letting go of anything is acknowledgment. What is the next step? How do I practically let go of that lie and live in the truth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it is making sure I am feeding my body, soul and spirit with truth and love. Personally, I wake up and spend time in God’s Word. It grounds me in truth and allows time for reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest in the truth and free the lies. It is a simple concept but requires an arduous effort to master. Do you recognize when shame starts to creep in? It is help to analyze what you are listening to and where your thoughts are taking you. Evaluate your actions and then act. Do not rest in shame, or lies. Shift your mindset and perspective into truth. It may mean taking a minute to breath or verbalize aloud positive self-talk. It may mean reaching out to your spouse or loved one and asking them to pray for you or speak into the lie or situation. It may also mean taking time and reflecting. Anchoring your identity, purpose, and relationships in the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talk a lot about understanding our why. Why do I feel like I am not enough? Why have I allowed shame to shape so much of my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be vulnerable. Open up those closets you keep shut. Open up to yourself, to a friend, or your partner. Vulnerability creates vulnerability. It brings light and truth into the darkness and lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My challenge to you is rest in the truth and free the lies. How we do that may look different for all of us. What are some of the ways you can live in the truth and free the lies?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="letting-go" /><summary type="html">On Tuesday, I shared about speaking truth into my life and letting go of the lies.

&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, I have been a number of sizes in my life. For so long, I believed when I lost the weight I would feel like I was enough. However, as I lost the weight, I began to realize the lie went much deeper than what showed on the outside. When I took my season of rest, it happened right after our wedding and moved away from all my family and friends. I went from loved ones around me, a full-time job, actively involved in a church, and going to school to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was heavier, I overcompensated by doing more and trying to being more. I busied myself by finding my worth in what I did. Fast forward to my season of rest where I started losing weight without trying but I had no one. No friends, no schedule, and no activities. As I felt like I was not enough in one area, I tried extra hard in the another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now looking back on both seasons and living my current one, where I am healthy, I still struggle with not being enough. Here I am healthy but I am not working. I have been married for four years but do not have children. How do I answer when someone asks what I do? I feel guilty because I know it is a privilege to not work and focus on my health but it can also be extremely lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circumstances change. They always will. Do I put my worth in my circumstances? In what I am doing today? In what I look like today? If I did, it would be fleeting. I would not be setting myself up for success but rather disappoint and failure because life is ever changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still learning, growing, processing and practicing how to control my thoughts around this by actively pushing out the lie and speaking truth. I am enough, not because of what I do or what I look like. I am enough because I believe I am enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple weeks, I am going to list more specific ways of letting go. I have to continue to rid my life of this lie and rest in the truth. For #tipthursday, I am going to share how I am practically doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

One of my all-time favorite side dishes is roasted butternut squash. Although, I sometimes opt for the already cubed butternut squash it is noticeably better if you buy it and chop it yourself. It is worth the effort, trust me.

&lt;p&gt;Roasted Butternut Squash
Servings: 4
Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 large butternut squash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2-4 Tablespoons avocado oil (depending on the size of squash)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 ½ teaspoons Primal Palate BBQ seasoning (or any BBQ seasoning)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon Italian Seasoning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sea Salt &amp;amp; Pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 400F.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut butternut squash into cubes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toss the everything in a bowl until butternut squash is fully coated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put butternut squash in a casserole dish (or cookie sheet with parchment paper)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bake for 50 mins - 1 hour or until the squash is golden and crispy on the edges.&lt;/li&gt;

Before we start, I think it is important to ponder what we need to let go of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take some time today or this weekend to reflect and journal some of the things/areas you want to let go of. As I started to list out mine, I was shocked with what I am still holding onto. After the first one, the ideas and thoughts kept on flowing. It was clear I needed to write it down. There is something healing about committing it to paper. It is a small step but a first step in letting go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TipThursdays are about small changes leading to big impacts down the road. I believe taking time to journal and actually write down things we need to let go of is an important step in taking back control of our thoughts. I talked about controlling what we can and releasing what we cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I will share an area I am letting go of and why. I hope you join me on this journey. Let us take back control over ourselves and let go of the areas keeping us captive and no longer serving us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="tip-thursday" /><category term="letting-go" /><summary type="html">On Tuesday, I shared about starting a series related to letting go.

&lt;p&gt;Letting go of control. Letting go of lies I believed. Letting go of things holding me captive. Letting go of clutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now until May, I am going to focus my #topictuesday and #tipthursdays on things I am practicing letting go. Every Tuesday (for this series) I will share my why and on Thursday I will outline practical ways of letting go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is beauty even in this season. Part of the beauty is the gift of time. I want to use this time to look deeper into my soul, spirit and heart. I want to actively be working towards the best version of myself. I desire to put habits into practice to carry over into all seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us practice letting go. There is freedom in removing the burdens shackling us down. Let us let go so we can fully walk in truth, lightness, and joy and run with endurance the path marked out for us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><category term="mindfulness" /><category term="letting-go" /><summary type="html">If I narrowed down what I learned these past few weeks to one thing, it would be my need to let go.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/bridge-in-woods_wphgny.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://h3withlaura.com/Blog/bridge-in-woods_wphgny.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mindful Snacking</title><link href="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/17/Thurs-Mindful-Snacking/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mindful Snacking" /><published>2020-04-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/17/Thurs-Mindful-Snacking</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://h3withlaura.com/2020/04/17/Thurs-Mindful-Snacking/">&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I talked about eating how I want to feel. It can be easy to say it aloud but how do we practically live it out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, start with asking yourself why. Why am I reaching for a snack? Next, examine the answer. Is it I am I hungry? I am bored? I am upset and finding myself turning to food for comfort? Only you know the answers and what your body needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you understand your why, there are a few things to ensure mindful snacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I mindfully snack is by cutting and preparing my vegetables and fruit. After, I put it at eye level in the fridge. Anytime I open the refrigerator, the first thing I see is easily accessible prepared veggies and fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Snacker” is in my DNA and honestly always will be. However, I need to moderate the amount I eat so I am not mindlessly consuming. I practice plating my snacks. Taking a whole bag of crackers to the couch to work on something or to watch TV never ends well. Plating my snacks sets me up to avoid overconsumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both tips are indeed simple. Tip Thursdays are all about small changes leading to big impacts down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

Have you ever stopped to think about food in the context of feeling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you want to feel right now? Yes, we are at home more than usual. Yes, we are likely more scared, on edge, and trying to keep anxiety in check but how do you want to feel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would be remiss to put water and gasoline into your car and expect it to run smoothly at peak performance without issue. Garbage in. Garbage out. Why do I find myself always grabbing a bag of chips or ice cream and eating until it is gone? Eating a tub of ice cream may provide instant gratification but leaves an unpaid bill for later. Everything consumed affects mood, health, and relationships. If I want to feel energetic, clear minded, healthy, and active, I fuel my body with nutrient rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding our “why” is of the utmost important. Why do I want to eat healthy? Identify first how you want to feel (I assume we all want to feel exceptional) as it helps us understand our purpose and motivation moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am by no means saying I do not consume treats. Eat in moderation and accordance with how I want to feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, I am going to discussing snacking with mindfulness with the uptick in working from home. I will outline practical tips to put mindful snacking into motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you want to feel? Why do you want to feel that way? Are you eating how you want to feel? As you start to ask these questions, exercise grace with yourself (especially in the current circumstances).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laura</name></author><category term="topic-tuesday" /><summary type="html">Do you eat how you want to feel?

  &lt;li&gt;Line your loaf pan with parchment paper and add your batter and toppings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour (mine took 55 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cool completely and store in the refrigerator for up to a week&lt;/li&gt;
