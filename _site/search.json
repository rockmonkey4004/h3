      "content"  : "I am known for a clean house because for me it creates a space of peace and calmness. Right now, many of our homes seem to become dirtier quicker than usual with more meals eaten at home and with an increase in activity.Personally, I like a deliberate and organized spot for everything. I regularly go through my clothes, drawers and cabinets to remove things I do not use. For me, it helps calm my anxiety and keep frustrations low. There are ample health benefits to living in a clean home to include lowering stress and fatigue, reducing allergy and asthma symptoms, and lessening the spread of germs.A study from Indiana University found people with clean houses were healthier people. The study described house cleanliness as a better predictor for physical health than neighborhood walkability. Another study out of Princeton University found clutter can make it more difficult to focus on a particular task. Specifically, they found the visual cortex can be overwhelmed by task-irrelevant objects, which made it harder to allocate attention and complete tasks efficiently. The National Sleep foundation reported people who make their beds every morning are 19 percent more likely to report getting a good night sleep and 75 percent of people say they achieve a better night sleep with clean sheets.As we are all home more, this a exceptional opportunity for us to spend some time deep cleaning and organizing the clutter. There is a lot in our lives we cannot control but we can control the cleanliness of our homes.One of our best home purchases was a robot vacuum. Let me tell you – it is one of the best purchases we made in our marriage. We run it just about every day (and it always picks up more dust than we could imagine). I always clean the kitchen and run the dishwasher after making dinner because starting the day with a clean kitchen is everything.In the beginning of the year, I told myself I would go through every room, closet and drawer in the house. I generally do one a week with only a few bedrooms left. Deep cleaning can seem overwhelming to do it all at once so I break it up. I separate regular chores (like cleaning the bathrooms, vacuuming, laundry) from cleaning showers tubs, baseboards, fans, shutters etc. I tend to do my regular chores during the week and leave the other ones to about monthly. I try to keep the extra bedrooms to standard of cleanliness to allow friends to stop by on short notice.With all this said, I do want to add to always be graceful with yourself. There have been times I did not complete what I hoped and that is alright. I think overall creating a standard of cleanliness helps set us up for success. Many of us are feeling more stressed and anxious than usual and cleanliness is one way that can help ease it. There is much we cannot control so let go of those areas and start focusing on what we can."

Trying something new does not have to be huge. It can be a small change, or a small step.I decided to stay away from social media and my phone when I first wake up. Right now, my goal is for the first hour. Instead of waking up and immediately turning over in bed to grab my phone, I am taking the time to check in with myself. I am focusing on my breath and spending time praying. After, I generally go and make my celery juice, empty the dishwasher, and spend time journaling, reading, praying and listening to worship.Let us all use this time we have to try some new things or create new practices and habits.

      "content"  : "Recently, my anxiety felt more crippling. I struggled with anxiety since high school. Through the years and through many doctors, I learned about “Candida” which is a yeast overgrowth in my gut. Candida is said to cause anxiety and other symptoms. As I started to heal my gut, I found significant relief but there were still times when it would come back.Although my anxiety subsided, it surged back with the passing of Beau and the uncertain time we are living in. I learned some techniques to combat the anxiety when it starts to take over.Exercise- Move my body to elevate my heart rate.Getting outside- Take a hike, walk, run, bike ride, or just sit on the porch. Being in nature helps reground me. Spring is still happening. The trees are still blooming and the birds are still chirping. It provides a sense of peace.Aromatherapy - When my anxiety starts to run rapid, it is soothing to roll essential oil on my chest or just breath the smells in.Pray/Worship- For me, reminding myself of truth and the God I serve helps to tackle the feeling of “things are out of my control”Breathe Deep- Laying down and focusing solely on my breath allows tension and thoughts to dissipate.I know we are all struggling in our own ways but it does not mean we are alone. I know things feel scary, out of control, and uncertain. Although we cannot control what is going on around us, we can control our response and how we are going to use this time. Let us prevent the fear from consuming us and our anxiety from winning.We have so much to hope in and hope for. There is beauty and joy in this season. Let us shift our perspective and press into the fulfilling things."

Although, I will say, at really crazy times in my life, I splurged on custom planners and they were worth the money.I use my planner to track workouts, appointments, work, Instagram posts, meals, and overall goals for the week. I normally sit down on Sunday and plan my week. It helps me stay organized and frees up mental space. I found I do not expand energy in thinking about dinner or planning tasks. It helps me stay less stressed and prioritize key areas of my life. It does not mean everything is set in stone.Plans can still be fluid. Mine change all the time, including what I make for dinner that night (for example: the menu for tonight included grilled chicken but it is raining. I swapped it for another menu item from the week). I’ve said it before and I’ll keep saying it- set yourself up for success. Small steps can lead success in desired area.Purchasing a planner is a small improvement to make an impact down the road.

      "content"  : "There is a lot that we cannot control right now but we are still in control of our response to what is going on around us. Most of us are spending more time at home and trying to come up with ideas to stay busy, keep kids entertained, and maintain our immune systems.One of the best ways is improve overall wellbeing stems from good sleep. I know everyone is not in a season where prioritizing sleep is an option (Any moms out there?) but if you are, it is crucial for your immune system. Mayo Clinic recommends adults to sleep 7-9 hours per night. The recommended sleep time can assist stabilizing blood sugar, fighting germs, weight control, boasts mood, sharpens brain activity, fosters a healthier heart, maximizes athletic achievement, and reduces stress/inflammation.I am sure many know the importance of sleep but may not know where to start. Seeing as most of us are practicing “social distancing”, it is a great time to put new habits into practiceOne of the biggest changes I made over the last few years concerning sleep, stems from paying attention to what I am drinking and eating. I routinely consumed caffeine until 4 PM but now stop at noon. I also decided to start drinking half caffeinated and half decaf coffee and limiting my coffee consumption to 2 cups a day. It made a tremendous impact on my sleep.I also talked about intermittent fasting (IF) in another post, but not eating past 7 PM makes a difference on my sleep. Now if I eat later or eat a heavy meal close to bed time, it takes me a lot longer to fall asleep. There are other habits for better sleep hygiene I hope to share with you all in the future, possibly for Tip Thursday. For now, I’ll list some common ones, challenge you to pick one, and commit to trying it for a week and then maybe extend to a month.Remember set yourself up for success.You know yourself the best, what you need, and how to realistically tackle it in your season of life.Limit naps, create a restful environment (dark and quiet room with a temperature around 65F), include physical activity in daily routine, stick to a sleep schedule (even in weekends), limit caffeine in late afternoon/evening, avoid consuming alcohol before bed, eat dinner 2-3 hours before bedtime, and limit electronic use at least 30 minutes before bedtime."

I thought it would be a pertinent topic to touch on since it is popular now.I personally participated in intermittent fasting for the last couple of years and still regularly partake. I try to finish eating by 7:30 PM or 8:00 PM on weekdays and generally do not eat until 11:30 AM or noon the next day. I did not start it for weight loss which seems to be the cause of a recent surge in popularity. I tried it to see if it addressed any of my gut issues and inflammation. IF seems to have a number of health benefits to include weight loss, reducing inflammation, improving memory, lowering blood pressure &amp;amp; sugar, improving endurance, maintaining muscle, and reducing oxidative stress.Improved sleep is the first thing I noticed. If I eat past my normal hours, I do not sleep as well. Also, I could tell my body liked it and I did not feel as if I was starving. Now, hunger does not set in until around noon. I recently modified my IF on workout days.I start my Orange Theory classes at 9:30 AM which would normally be during my IF period. However, I could feel in my workout my body felt hungry and my energy was not quite there. On Friday, I ate one of my protein balls before class and brought another one for after. I saw an improvement.All of this to say, I vary my IF depending on the rhythms of my lifestyle. In my current season, exercise is frequent in the morning so I’ve reduced IF. But if I exercise later in the day, or take days off I implement IF. Everyone is different and every body is unique so tune into your needs as your lifestyle changes and adapts. What works today may not work next month. A healthy lifestyle is a fluid journey.What does your body need? Have you tried IF? What are your thoughts?"

Keep in mind those are averages so other factors like exercise, pregnancy, overall health and environment may change the amount your body needs.Every tissue, cell, and organ in your body needs water to function properly. Water helps your temperature remain normal, rids the body of waste, and protects joints and sensitive tissues. Even if your body is mildly dehydrated, it can drain energy and cause fatigue.In order for me to drink as much water as my body needs, I carry a water bottle. I take it everywhere I go: the gym, grocery store, errands, friend’s houses, and I drink out of it at home. By carrying it everywhere, I can keep track of how much I drink and it serves a reminder to continue to hydrate.Small steps when beginning your own journey of “health, healing, &amp;amp; hope” can lead to significant, cumulative, and impactful results down the road.

      "content"  : "For Topic Tuesday, I thought I would share how I prioritize movement and exercise in my week.Until recently, up until the last few months, I ceased any high intensity training. Prior to my sickness and even while sick, I worked out hard, often too hard. A doctor advised me to take a season of rest and I terminated working out. I primarily spent my season of rest bedridden with occasional walks a few times a week. I tried CrossFit and loved it but it caused my body to crash so I stopped.Once we moved to Nashville, I intended to start a rigorous exercise routine again. However, my body required additional time for healing as the move spiked my stress levels. I did squeeze in more movement than before and I felt better. I limited myself walking and yoga classes during the time. Once we moved in our house, we setup a home gym in the garage, and I started strength training a couple days per week.All in all, it took three years of breaking from conducting high intensity training to recover. During those three years of trusting and listening to what my body needed, the weight started to come off. For so long, I worked to become skinny. I over trained and under-fueled my body. I believed the world: I was overweight because of my choices. This mindset resulted in health issues, weight gain, and an unhealthy relationship with both food and exercise.I think it is powerful and paramount to avoid comparing ourselves to each other. I do not want you to see I prioritizing exercise 5 days a week and ample movement without seeing the full picture of what it has taken me to heal.Sometimes we need rest, and rest is GOOD. Rest helped my body to heal and allowed me to be where I am now. Exercise &amp;amp; movement are important but must align with what your body is telling you. Right now, I am in a season of low stress and high energy. I am feeling spirited and I know my body is ready for more than just walks and hikes.Since January, I started Orange Theory and I love it! I started with 2 days a week but moved to the unlimited package. My goal is train 5 times a week while still listening to my body and understanding some weeks may require additional rest and recovery. My dog Beau, the sweetest Goldendoodle, needs to go on walks which helps incorporate more movement in a day.There are a host of benefits to regular physical activity- better sleep, boosting mood, increased energy and sex drive, combating health conditions and diseases (metabolic syndrome, anxiety, high blood pressure, depression etc.), and helping to regulate weight. If your body is at a place capable of increased physical activity, exercise and movement, it could be fruitful to start prioritizing it.Start with a plan and achievable goals. Set yourself up for success to avoid disappointment. Take the time to evaluate what works and set your goals accordingly. For example, I started with committing to 2 days a week.After consistent exercise, I saw my body could handle more and I changed my goal.What are some of your goals around exercise and movement?"

      "content"  : "Tip Thursday will be focused on small digestible changes capable of making an extensive impact as time progresses.I learned a significant amount on my journey. In the beginning, I struggled to find clean items at grocery store, and critically evaluate household/beauty products. Also, I floundered in managing my stress, and selecting exercise type and frequency.I hope to help educate others on ingredients/products to be mindful of when approaching food and lifestyle changes.My goal with Tip Thursday is to ease the stress often felt with making healthier choices.Small steps when beginning your own journey of “health, healing, &amp;amp; hope” can lead to significant cumulative impact down the road."

      "content"  : "I spent time today organizing our pantry &amp;amp; spice cabinet and I’m so glad I did it!One thing that I have learned through all my health struggles is how to manage my stress. One of the ways for me is keeping the space I live in clean and organized.Recently I made a goal to go through every draw, room, closet and cabinet in our house.Even though I wouldn’t consider myself a minimalist, my desire is to get rid of clutter and unused items. For me, being in a space that has less and is clean provides so much more peace and comfort.I like to set weekly goals for myself and schedule time to achieve them in my planner. This week it was to organize the spice cabinet and it just made sense to do the pantry as well. I may share in stories what I have in my pantry. So stay tuned!Have you set any goals for yourself? What are some things that you do to ensure you reach them?"

      "content"  : "Dinner last night was 😍 I’ve been really into sautéed kale lately.I wanted to share a little bit about my food journey today because my plate didn’t always look like this.Growing up I was overweight and had a problem with indulgence. We really didn’t eat a lot of junk food in my house (my Mom is an amazing cook) so when I would go to a friend’s house or away from my parents I consumed so much junk food I would make myself sick. In middle school I was teased, the popular name being little piggy. I always struggled with why my friends (who were “thin”) could eat a pretzel and cheese every day from the cafeteria and not care. Even by 7th grade I associated eating certain foods with being fat and shamed myself for consuming them.I was an active kid/high schooler. I played soccer growing up and swam. However, I still somehow managed to be on the heavier side. My eating disorder came early on, when I felt guilt and shame for eating certain foods. But then it got worse because anytime I would indulge in those foods I would make myself sick, convinced that they would make me fat. The pain and grossness I felt from being bulimic felt deserved for eating them in the first place. I viewed it as a punishment to myself.Freshmen year of college I got to my heaviest just above 200 pounds, with my bulimia getting a little out of control. I found myself in the bathroom stall, crying and puking almost daily. I finally decided to get my butt in gear. From that point on, I started counting calories and working out for hours a day. I got to 160 at some point, but after a trip overseas found my weight creep back up.When I got home I worked out harder, ate less and never allowed myself bread, cereal or any of the “bad” foods. Yet somehow, I kept gaining weight instead of losing it. A lot of people didn’t believe me when I told them what I ate in a day because what I looked like didn’t match up. That made me extra careful to never eat a “bad” food in the event that those people would then feel solidified with their belief (even if it was wrong). It took me writing down everything I ate for weeks to even convince my parents. I was pushing close to 200 again and with the journals I kept and my parents on my side I was able to see someone about my thyroid. Little did I know that this would be a start to a very long, painful, confusing and hard health journey.Fast forward a couple years of being on thyroid medicine, I still hadn’t lost weight and continued to get worse physically, mentally and emotionally. Luckily my parents were extremely supportive and spent countless hours advocating for me.Finally, by 22, years after being on the thyroid medicine, going out of state and seeing every type of doctor and naturopath under the sun, I found someone who believed me and was willing to help.The things he told me to do were drastic, big lifestyle changes that impacted pretty much everything (more on those another time). At this point I was so desperate for someone to help me feel better and look better I would have done anything. When he told me, I needed to cut out sugar, gluten, diary, grains and eat a “Paleo” diet I committed.I’ve been eating mostly paleo ever since. In these past 5 years there has been a lot of ups and downs, protocols, elimination diets, struggling with the urge to be bulimic again and giving up the need to be “skinny”. Ironically when I finally got to the point of surrender, when I stopped over exercising, managed my stress, took a season of rest and stopped counting calories was when the weight started falling off.Here I am years later and am still learning to surrender, to work through the shame, guilt and need to be skinny and now stay skinny. It’s a journey but one I am very thankful for.So wherever you are on your health and healing journey, know you are not alone and know there is hope."
