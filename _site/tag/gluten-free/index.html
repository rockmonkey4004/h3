  <li><a href="/2020/09/29/Blueberry-Scone/">Blueberry Scone</a> - 29 Sep 2020<br>

  <li><a href="/2020/09/15/Pumpkin-Cookies/">4 Ingredient Pumpkin Cookies</a> - 15 Sep 2020<br>

  <li><a href="/2020/09/11/Cookie-Skillet-with-Carmel-Sauce/">Skillet Cookie with Carmel Sauce</a> - 11 Sep 2020<br>
    When I lived in Anchorage, a local restaurant did a cookie skillet with caramel sauce and ice cream on top. They served it warm and it was to die for. I still think about it so I decided to create a paleo and egg free version.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/09/04/Vegan-Mac-and-Cheese/">3 Ingredient Vegan Mac & Cheese</a> - 04 Sep 2020<br>
    This vegan mac & cheese hits the spot. The best part is there is no soaking cashews or making your own sauce.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/09/02/Chocolate-Bites/">Brownie Protein Bites</a> - 02 Sep 2020<br>
    I originally was not a chocolate lover (I know strange) but in the last few years I started to like it more and more. Brownies are starting to be my thing- especially cold.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/08/28/Almond-Milk/">Almond Milk</a> - 28 Aug 2020<br>

  <li><a href="/2020/08/25/Pumpkin-Spice/">Pumpkin Spice Sauce</a> - 25 Aug 2020<br>

  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/08/21/Ice_Cream_Sandwiches/">Ice Cream Sandwiches</a> - 21 Aug 2020<br>

  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/08/14/Lemon-Dijon-Chicken/">Lemon Dijon Chicken</a> - 14 Aug 2020<br>
    You all asked for dinner ideas and this will quickly become a crowd favorite. It is easy to whip together and can be prepared the morning or afternoon before dinner. I love to serve it with a side of green beans and sweet potatoes but it would pair great with rice.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/08/12/Paleo-Peanut-Butter-Protein-Bites/">Peanut Butter Protein Balls</a> - 12 Aug 2020<br>
    Have you ever had Go Marco Bars? My husband loves them so I decided to try and make something similar. These have 5 ingredients and take less than 10 minutes to make. You can roll them into balls or bars.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/08/07/Cashew-Coconut-Chocolate-Milk/">Cashew Coconut Chocolate Milk</a> - 07 Aug 2020<br>

  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/07/31/Lemon-Blueberry-Muffins/">Blueberry Lemon Muffins</a> - 31 Jul 2020<br>
    Blueberries are in season and this is a fantastic way to use them! These are easy to pull together, totally vegan, refined sugar free, oil free, and gluten free. The maple lemon butter kicks it up to a whole new level and the grass-fed butter can easily be replaced with vegan butter.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/07/22/Energy-Bits/">Energy Bites</a> - 22 Jul 2020<br>
    I thought I would share my Energy Bite recipe because we could all use a little more energy on this Wednesday, right? Honestly though, this is a great snack to keep in the fridge to grab before a workout or rushing out the door.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/07/17/Peach-Kale-Salad/">Chopped Peach Kale Salad</a> - 17 Jul 2020<br>
    It is peach season here in the south and although I love them most in a crisp they are also very delicious in a salad. This recipe is easy and so yummy. The goat cheese mixes in great and makes the salad creamy, light and flavorful.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/07/10/Feta-Kale-Turkey-Burgers/">Feta & Kale Turkey Burgers</a> - 10 Jul 2020<br>
    I love a good turkey burger over a bed of lettuce. I made this on a whim and loved it! It is very easy and versatile which makes for a perfect weeknight meal. I used rice crumbs in this recipe but if you want to keep it grain free just swap it for almond flour.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/07/03/Fudgy-Brownies/">Fudgy Brownies</a> - 03 Jul 2020<br>
    I am sharing one of my all-time favorite recipes- fudgy brownies with crispy edges, SO good. If you need an easy and delicious dessert for the holiday weekend, look no further. It is Gluten Free, paleo, egg-free and refined-sugar-free but I promise no one will be able to tell.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/06/26/Funfetti-Cake/">Funfetti Cake</a> - 26 Jun 2020<br>
    I am a big fan of Funfetti cake so I wanted to make it for my birthday this year. However, don’t wait until your birthday to make this. We can always find a reason to celebrate right? This recipe is easy and can be paleo and vegan with a few tweaks. I cannot find paleo sprinkles, so unfortunately those have refined sugar but they are dye free.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/06/23/Chicken-Salad/">Mom's Chicken Salad</a> - 23 Jun 2020<br>
    Instead of Topic Tuesday today, I thought I would share an easy and perfect summer recipe. I always loved my Mom’s chicken salad and knew I needed to make my own version.

  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/05/23/Refined-Sugar-Free-Mocha-Sauce/">Mocha Sauce</a> - 23 May 2020<br>
    Sugar is a sneaky ingredient and is in all the fun drinks like an iced mocha I decided it was time to create my own mocha sauce. Let me tell you- it will make you not miss Starbucks at all. Enjoy an iced mocha with all the yumminess but without the sugar crash.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/05/15/Fire-Roasted-Salsa-Applewood/">Fire Roasted Salsa</a> - 15 May 2020<br>
    This recipe is easy to do and always a crowd pleaser. It is a fantastic way to up your taco game.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/05/08/Strawberry-Pecan-Crisp/">Strawberry Pecan Crisp</a> - 08 May 2020<br>
    Last weekend we went to a farm and picked strawberries so I obviously had to make a strawberry crisp. It turned out so yummy, I could not wait to share it with you! If you do not have strawberries on hand, no worries as any berries will work.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/04/24/Roasted-Butternut-Squash/">Roasted Butternut Squash</a> - 24 Apr 2020<br>
    Roasted butternut squash is one of my all-time favorite side dishes. Although, I sometimes opt for the already cubed butternut squash it is noticeably better if you buy it and chop it yourself. It’s worth the effort, trust me. I love to use any leftovers we have on salad, my favorite being my “Burger Up” house salad.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/04/17/Greek-Salad/">Greek Salad</a> - 17 Apr 2020<br>

  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/03/25/nut-butter-toast/">Nut Butter Toast</a> - 25 Mar 2020<br>
    It is easy to make and satisfies both sweet and savory lovers. I use a cracker for this but you can do bread or a rice cake!
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/03/13/Pizza/">Pizza</a> - 13 Mar 2020<br>
    I want to share our pizza recipe. My husband’s part always includes mozzarella. I generally do sheep & goat’s milk feta on mine. I use any leftover meat we have from the week as a topping.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/02/28/Paleo-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies/">Paleo Chocolate Chip Cookies</a> - 28 Feb 2020<br>
    It is paleo & egg free! I use grass-fed butter but you can sub palm shortening if needed.
