  <li><a href="/2020/09/23/My-Relationship-with-Food-Pt-3/">My Relationship with Food (Part 3)</a> - 23 Sep 2020<br>
    I truly believe, if we take the time to allow our bodies to heal, nourish it with nutrient dense food, sleep, and conduct adequate movement, healing is on the other side. Hold onto hope and keep fighting because my story is a testament that healing is possible and it will not last forever.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/09/17/Thurs-My-Relationship-with-Food-Part-2/">My Relationship with Food (Part 2)</a> - 17 Sep 2020<br>
    When I noticed my stomach worse, I switched to paleo about a year ago and continue to follow it now. No matter what I ate, even if it was raw almonds, chicken, or roasted veggies, my stomach would hurt and become bloated. During the same time, I navigated a season of rest which meant most of my days were spent in bed. The season allowed my body to recover and heal.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/09/10/Thurs-My-Relationship-with-Food/">My Relationship with Food</a> - 10 Sep 2020<br>
    I figured breaking this into three different posts would be easiest. My relationship with food changed over the years. I want to share what I did when the stomach/health issues flared, what I did when I was at my worst, and where I am at now after seeing significant healing and improvement.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/08/27/Thurs-Healthy-Dessert-Swap/">Easy Healthy Dessert Modification</a> - 27 Aug 2020<br>
    A look at some easy tips to modify your dessert routine.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/08/20/Never-Settle/">Never Settle</a> - 20 Aug 2020<br>
    If you are struggling with irritable bowel, autoimmune disease, pain, fatigue, migraines, or any medical disease there is hope. You know your body best so be your own advocate. I know the journey feels long, impossible, disappointing but do not settle. You are worth it so show up for yourself, even when you do not want to because it is arduous.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/08/13/Thurs-Just-Breathe/">Just Breathe</a> - 13 Aug 2020<br>
    The other day my mind started going all sorts of ways. I could tell I was sinking into a worst-case scenario mindset. As my mind started to race so did my heart, which in turn triggered my anxiety. I could tell my body was physically responding to what I was thinking and feeling.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/07/30/Thurs-The-Low-Down-On-My-Snacks/">The Low Down on My Snacks</a> - 30 Jul 2020<br>
    Crazy snack girl over here! Anyone else? Seriously though, I think I love snacks because I am not limited to choosing one thing. I can have a little bit of everything. I thought I would share some of my favorite healthier options for snacks.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/07/25/Thurs-Choices-Choices-Choices/">Read the Labels</a> - 25 Jul 2020<br>
    This is such a stellar example of why it is important to read labels. I mentioned it before but small changes can make lasting impacts. Choosing the marinara sauce without added sugar and inflammatory oils is a small but meaningful change.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/07/09/Getting-Off-Sugar/">Getting off Sugar</a> - 09 Jul 2020<br>
    Did you know that sugar is 8 times more addictive than cocaine? Sugar is said to be the root cause of our obesity epidemic and chronic diseases.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/06/25/Thurs-Birthday-Cake/">Sugar Types</a> - 25 Jun 2020<br>
    Store bought powdered sugar is filled with refined sugar and cornstarch. My powdered sugar is made with pure maple sugar and a little bit of arrowroot. I promise it is even better than store bought both tastewise, and healthwise.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/05/22/Thurs-Resounding-Yes/">Letting Go Series (Resounding Yes)</a> - 22 May 2020<br>
    For Topic Tueaday, I shared about my goal of saying no is to create opportunity to spend my time on things I value most in life. It took me years to feel confident in saying no if it is not an unmistakable yes.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/05/14/Letting-Go-of-Exercise-for-Weightloss/">Letting Go Series (Exercise for Weightloss)</a> - 14 May 2020<br>
    One way I improved my wellbeing was by avoiding the scale. I used to go on it two/three times per week. Now, I only went on it once the last three/four months. Muscle weighs more than fat. When I start to exercise, specifically weightlifting, I gain weight.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/04/30/Thurs-I-Am-Enough-Cont/">Letting Go Series (I Am Enough - Part 2)</a> - 30 Apr 2020<br>
    Rest in the truth and free the lies. It is a simple concept but requires an arduous effort to master. Do you recognize when shame starts to creep in? It is help to analyze what you are listening to and where your thoughts are taking you. Evaluate your actions and then act. Do not rest in shame, or lies. Shift your mindset and perspective into truth.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/04/23/Thurs-Letting-Go-Part-1/">Letting Go (Series - Part 1)</a> - 23 Apr 2020<br>
    Take some time today or this weekend to reflect and journal some of the things/areas you want to let go of. As I started to list out mine, I was shocked with what I am still holding onto. After the first one, the ideas and thoughts kept on flowing. It was clear I needed to write it down. There is something healing about committing it to paper. It is a small step but a first step in letting go.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/04/17/Thurs-Mindful-Snacking/">Mindful Snacking</a> - 17 Apr 2020<br>
    One way I mindfully snack is by cutting and preparing my vegetables and fruit. After, I put it at eye level in the fridge. Anytime I open the refrigerator, the first thing I see is easily accessible prepared veggies and fruit.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/04/09/Thurs-Holidays/">Easter- Making the Holiday Special Under our Circumstances</a> - 09 Apr 2020<br>
    What can you do to make this holiday special? Can you hide Easter eggs (or just little treasures if you do not have eggs) around the house for your kids to find? Can you make a special dessert? Can you Facetime loved ones while you are sitting around your table?
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/04/02/Thurs-Try-Something-New/">Try Something New</a> - 02 Apr 2020<br>
    Tip Thursdays are about making small changes for a significant impact down the road. Trying something new does not have to be huge. It can be a small change, or a small step.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/03/26/Thurs-Wash-Produce/">Wash your Fruits and Veggies</a> - 26 Mar 2020<br>
    Washing produce is important to prevent foodborne illness and reducing your exposure to pesticides. For good food hygiene, learn how to wash produce, regardless if it is organic or conventional.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/03/19/Thurs-Planner/">Use a Planner</a> - 19 Mar 2020<br>
    I use my planner to track workouts, appointments, work, Instagram posts, meals, and overall goals for the week. I normally sit down on Sunday and plan my week. It helps me stay organized and frees up mental space.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/03/12/Thurs-Pack-Snacks/">Pack Some Snacks</a> - 12 Mar 2020<br>
    For me, snacks can be a life saver. I carry an RX bar and other goodies in my purse for “emergencies”. You know the times where you run late and forget to eat breakfast, errands take longer than planned, or someone brought donuts to work?
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/03/05/Carry-Water/">Carry a Water Bottle</a> - 05 Mar 2020<br>
    Did you know that 43% of adults drink less than 4 cups of water a day? According to Mayo Clinic, women need about 11.5 cups and men need 15.5 cups. Keep in mind those are averages so other factors like exercise, pregnancy, overall health and environment may change the amount your body needs.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/02/28/Thurs-Tip-Thurs/">Highlighting Tip Thursday</a> - 28 Feb 2020<br>
    Tip Thursday will be focused on small digestible changes capable of making an extensive impact as time progresses.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="/2020/02/21/Thurs-Organize/">Spend Time Clearing the Clutter</a> - 21 Feb 2020<br>
    Recently, I made a goal to go through every drawer, room, closet and cabinet in our house. Even though I wouldn’t consider myself a minimalist, my desire is to get rid of clutter and unused items. For me, being in a space that has less and is clean provides so much more peace and comfort.
