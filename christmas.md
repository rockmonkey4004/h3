Thank you so much for stopping by! I am Laura Sanders and the creator of Health, Healing & Hope (H3).

H3 incorporates lifestyle changes including focusing on nutrient dense foods, managing stress, and learning to listen to our bodies. I started my own H3 journey about 6 years ago when I experienced a host of symptoms and undiagnosed health issues.

One of the big lifestyle changes I made was an overhaul of my food. The first few years were really hard and I spent many holidays and family gatherings feeling left out as I could not partake in most of the food being served.

My heart behind my Christmas Treat E-Book is to provide recipes that not only taste good but help us continue to feel good. I know many of you are on your own journey of H3 and I hope that these recipes inspire you to enjoy the holidays without feeling restricted and left out.

These are family favorite recipes I recreated without the refined sugar, gluten, grains, eggs, or dairy and are paleo and vegan friendly. If you are unsure what paleo is, or are just wanting to add some paleo recipes to your rotation you can find more information on that [here](https://h3withlaura.com/2020/10/13/paleo-101/)! Also, if you are unsure of where to buy the ingredients head to my [recommended items](https://h3withlaura.com/recommended-items/) page, I have almost all the ingredients you need linked!

Lastly, if you want to follow along my H3 journey you can find me on Instagram [(@lauramsanders)](https://www.instagram.com/lauramsanders/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/h3withlaura). If you make any of these recipes, please share, tag me and #h3 and #h3withlaura . It brings me so much joy to be able to see what you are making!

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays from my kitchen to yours!
