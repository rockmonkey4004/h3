# Installation

* Add `jekyll_picture_tag` to your Gemfile in the `:jekyll_plugins` group:

  ```ruby
  group :jekyll_plugins do
    gem 'jekyll_picture_tag'
  end
  ```

* Run `$ bundle install`

* See if you have ImageMagick with `$ convert --version`. You should see something like this:

  ```
  ~ $ convert --version 
  Version: ImageMagick 7.0.8-14 Q16 x86_64 2018-10-31 https://imagemagick.org
  Copyright: Â© 1999-2018 ImageMagick Studio LLC License: https://imagemagick.org/script/license.php
  Features: Cipher DPC HDRI OpenMP Delegates (built-in): bzlib fontconfig freetype jng jp2 jpeg lcms
  lzma pangocairo png tiff webp xml zlib
  ```
  If you get a 'command not found' error, you'll need to install it. Most package managers know about
  ImageMagick, otherwise it can be found [here](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php).

* **Note webp under delegates.** This is required if you want to generate webp files. Any image format
you want to handle will require an appropriate delegate; You may have to install additional packages
to accomplish this.
