# Jekyll Picture Tag

**Easy responsive images for Jekyll.**

It's easy to throw an image on a webpage and call it a day. Doing justice to your users by serving
it efficiently on all browsers and screen sizes is tedious and tricky. Tedious, tricky things should be
automated.

Jekyll Picture Tag adds responsive images to your [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) static site. It
automatically creates resized, reformatted source images, is fully configurable, implements sensible
defaults, and solves both the art direction and resolution switching problems with a little YAML
configuration and a simple template tag.

## Why use Responsive Images?

**Performance:** The fastest sites are static sites, but when you plonk a 2mb picture of your dog at
the top of a blog post you're throwing it all away.  Responsive images allow you to keep your site
fast, without compromising image quality.

**Design:** Your desktop image may not work well on mobile, regardless of its resolution. We often
want to do more than just resize images for different screen sizes, we want to crop them or use a
different image entirely.

## Why use Jekyll Picture Tag?

**Developer Sanity:** If you want to serve multiple images in multiple formats and resolutions, you
have a litany of markup to write and a big pile of images to generate. Jekyll Picture Tag is your
responsive images minion - give it simple instructions and it'll handle the rest. 

## Features

* Automatic generation and organization of resized image files in basically any format(s).
